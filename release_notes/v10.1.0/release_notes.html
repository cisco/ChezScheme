<h3><a name="./release_notes:h1"></a>2. Functionality Changes</h3>


<a name="section:functionality"></a>

<p>

<a name="g2"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h2"></a>2.1. Constrain signal delivery to the main thread (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
Signals are now always delivered to the main Scheme thread to avoid crashes when a signal
is delivered to a thread that may not even be running Scheme.

<p>

<a name="g3"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h3"></a>2.2. Improved support for lists in type recovery (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
The type recovery pass has improved support for lists by classifying pairs as mutable or
immutable. Type recovery is enabled with the <tt>enable-type-recovery</tt> parameter.

<p>

<a name="g4"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h4"></a>2.3. New machine types for iOS (10.1.0)</h4>


<a name="section:ios-machine-types"></a>

<p>
The a6ios, ta6ios, arm64ios and tarm64ios machine types correspond to an
iOS compilation target. Native-code support for iOS is currently limited
to applications attached to a debugger as the platform does not allow
executable code to be loaded at runtime.

<p>

<a name="g5"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h5"></a>2.4. Standard boolean foreign type (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
The <tt>stdbool</tt> foreign type corresponds to <tt>bool</tt> as
defined by the host machine's <tt>stdbool.h</tt> include file.

<p>

<a name="g6"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h6"></a>2.5. Optimization for <tt>call/cc</tt> (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
When <tt>call/cc</tt> is applied to an immediate function that does
not use its argument, then the application is replaced with the body
of that function, which avoids the potential work of capturing a
continuation at run time.

<p>

<a name="g7"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h7"></a>2.6. New procedure <tt>flbit-field</tt> (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
The <tt>flbit-field</tt> procedure extracts bits from an IEEE 64-bit
floating-point representation in a way that is analogous to
<tt>bitwise-bit-field</tt> on an exact integer.

<p>

<a name="g8"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h8"></a>2.7. Unicode 15.1 support (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
The character sets, character classes, and word-breaking algorithms for character, string,
and Unicode-related bytevector operations have now been updated to Unicode 15.1.

<p>

<a name="g9"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h9"></a>2.8. New supported platforms and portable bytecode (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
AArch64 (64-bit Arm), RV64G (64-bit RISC-V), and LoongArch64 architectures are
supported. Threads are supported on architectures with weak memory
models while preserving the safety guarantee described in the
documentation for variables and primitive datatypes.

<p>
The pb ("portable bytecode") machine type corresponds to a virtual
machine that the Chez Scheme kernel can interpret on practically any
desktop platform. This machine type is used to enable bootstrapping on
all native-code platforms using a single set of boot files. The pb
machine type is also used to support platforms for which Chez Scheme
does not have a supported native-code generator. For the latter use,
the pb32l, pb32b, pb64l, and pb64b machine types specialize the
interpreter to a word size and endianness, which improves performance.
For example, pb32l is a suitable machine type for compiling to
WebAssembly via Emscripten. Each pb variant has a corresponding
threaded variant: tpb, tpb32l, tpb32b, tpb64l, and tpb64b.

<p>
The <tt>pbchunk-convert-file</tt> procedure can convert sequences of
static pb bytecode into C code. The generated C code can be compiled
and linked with the Chez Scheme kernel to reduce the overhead of
bytecode interpretation. In particular, since Chez Scheme is mostly
written in Chez Scheme, a pbchunk conversion of its boot files
improves performance of primitives and compilation.

<p>

<a name="g10"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h10"></a>2.9. Threaded default and build system changes (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
Running <tt>configure</tt> assumes a threaded target machine type,
unless <tt>--nothreads</tt> or a non-threaded machine type is
specified.

<p>
The build system mostly uses Zuo instead of Make, but the
<tt>configure</tt> script continues to generate wrapper makefiles, so
that there's no difference for most users who build from source and do
not modify Chez Scheme. The build process on Windows has changed so
that Unix-style tools are not required, but using Unix-style tools to
compile with MinGW is supported.

<p>
The Chez Scheme sources no longer include boot files for multiple
platforms. Instead, a single set of pb boot files is normally used to
build on any platform. This change makes an initial build of Chez
Scheme slower, but it makes the build process consistent across all
supported platforms and enables a much smaller source size.
Alternatively, Chez Scheme can be bootstrapped from an older version
of Chez Scheme (9.5.4 or later) using the <tt>re.boot</tt> makefile
target.

<p>
The new <tt>scheme-build-number</tt> function complements
<tt>scheme-version-number</tt>, adding an extra level of versioning
during development. The <tt>scheme-build-number</tt> procedure always
returns zero for a released version of Chez Scheme.

<p>

<a name="g11"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h11"></a>2.10. Compiler improvements (10.0.0)</h4>


<a name="sec:unbox-floats"></a>

<p>
The compiler generates code that locally unboxes floating-point
operations, so that compositions of floating-point operations can be
much faster.

<p>
The compiler infers information about the type of value produced
by an expression, and it uses that information to eliminate run-time
checks or conditionals. For example, within
<tt>(if&nbsp;(flonum?&nbsp;x)&nbsp;<i>E1</i>&nbsp;<i>E2</i>)</tt>,
assuming that the variable <tt>x</tt> is never
mutated, then it holds a flonum value within <tt><i>E1</i></tt>, so
arithmetic can be specialized to flonum operations. Type inference
requires an additional pass for compilation, but when compiling in
safe mode, the pass tends to more than pay for itself; reduced checks
and error handling create less work for later compilation passes.
Even when many checks are removed, run-time performance may improve
only modestly on modern hardware, since the removed branches are
perfectly predictable. Inference can be disabled by setting
<tt>enable-type-recovery</tt> to <tt>#f</tt>.

<p>
The compiler can infer more than previously about procedures that
always return a value or that never return (because they raise a
noncontinuable exception). The compiler will no longer move an
expression from a non-tail position to a tail position if that
movement could be detected with continuation marks (see
Section&nbsp;<a href="./release_notes.html#g13">2.12</a>), and it will not change a program in a
way that discards an error due to returning multiple values to a
single-value context. The <tt>assert-unreachable</tt> procedure always
reports an error in safe mode, but it in unsafe mode, it must never be
called; the claim that some code is unreachable propagates backward to
remove other code that must also be unreachable, and even drop
conditionals that must always go the other way to avoid unreachable
code. A macro expansion might use <tt>assert-unreachable</tt> to
indicate that unsafe mode can assume that a check succeeded and
eliminate the check, for example.

<p>
The compiler consistently "lifts" procedures: When a procedure has
only known call sites, refers to only immutable variables bound
outside the procedure, and has only call site within the scope of
those variables, then variables used by the procedure are converted to
arguments, and call sites are converted to supply the variables as
arguments. As a result, nested procedure definitions can be used more
freely without a potential cost from closure allocation. There are
programs where forming a closure would be faster, but consistent
lifting is almost always faster in practice.

<p>
Cross-library inlining can apply to a procedure that is exported
from a library (explicitly or implicitly) and whose body refers to
another procedure or other variable that is also exported (explicitly
or implicitly).

<p>
The compiler reduces code size by using a more compact representation
for most call-return sites and by using a more compact dispatch to
interrupt checking in most cases.

<p>
The internal representation of record types has changed so that a
record-type predicate is a constant-time operation, instead of
proportional to the subtype depth.

<p>

<a name="g12"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h12"></a>2.11. Garbage-collector improvements (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
Garbage collection takes advantage of machine parallelism. Parallel
collection is automatically enabled when a program has multiple Scheme
threads active at the point that a garbage collection starts, but
parallel collection can benefit from a hint about which threads are
most relevant as allocators (see Section&nbsp;<a href="./release_notes.html#g27">2.26</a>).

<p>
The garbage collector uses a hybrid mark-copy algorithm, which
can improve performance for large objects and long-lived objects
compared to a pure copying collector. The
<tt>in-place-minimum-generation</tt> parameter tunes the hybrid by
selecting the youngest generation at which marking is used.

<p>
The <tt>collect-maximum-generation-threshold-factor</tt> parameter is
used by <tt>collect</tt> when called with no arguments. In the case
that the maximum generation would be collected based on the gc-trip
counter, it is collected only when the total memory use is at least <i>k</i>
times the memory use just after the most recent collection of the maximum
generation, where the parameter's value is <i>k</i>. The default value of 2
helps the collector adapt to the scenario that a program has much more
long-lived data than short-lived data, and where the program does not
explicitly promote its long-lived data to the static generation.
Setting the parameter to 0 makes <tt>collect</tt> behave as in
previous versions of Chez Scheme.

<p>
See also Sections&nbsp;<a href="./release_notes.html#g28">2.27</a> and <a href="./release_notes.html#g29">2.28</a> for
related new functionality.

<p>

<a name="g13"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h13"></a>2.12. Continuation marks (10.0.0)</h4>


<a name="sec:cont-marks"></a>

<p>
<i>Continuation marks</i> add key-value information to continuations.
The <tt>with-continuation-mark</tt> form associates a key-value pair
to the current continuation, replacing any same-keyed mark already
associated to the immediate continuation, and adding to marks
associated with continuations that the current continuation extends.
Inspect marks with these functions:

<p>

<p><tt>current-continuation-marks<br>

continuation-next-marks<br>

continuation-marks-first<br>

continuation-marks-&gt;list<br>

continuation-marks-&gt;iterator<br>

call-with-immediate-continuation-mark<br>

continuation-marks?</tt>
<p>The <tt>call-in-continuation</tt> function can invoke a continuation
similar to calling a procedure as a function, but instead of a value
to deliver to the continuation, it takes a procedure of no arguments
to call within the continuation.

<p>

<a name="g14"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h14"></a>2.13. New fixnum operations (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
New operations support common bit-related operations on fixnums:

<p>

<p><tt>fx+/wraparound<br>

fx-/wraparound<br>

fx*/wraparound<br>

fxsll/wraparound<br>

fxpopcount<br>

fxpopcount32<br>

fxpopcount16</tt>
<p>Immutable fixnum vectors are no longer supported, so the following
functions are removed:

<p>

<p><tt>fxvector-&gt;immutable-fxvector&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;&nbsp;removed<br>

mutable-fxvector?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;&nbsp;removed<br>

immutable-fxvector?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;&nbsp;removed</tt>
<p>
<a name="g15"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h15"></a>2.14. New flonum operations (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
The <tt>eq?</tt> operator works on flonums in the sense that two
flonums values that are <tt>eq?</tt> at some point (such as creation
time) will continue to be <tt>eq?</tt> in the future.

<p>
Mutable flonum vectors cooperate with local unboxing (see
Section&nbsp;<a href="./release_notes.html#g11">2.10</a>) and are supported through the
following functions:

<p>

<p><tt>flvector?<br>

make-flvector<br>

flvector-length<br>

flvector-ref<br>

flvector-set!<br>

flvector-fill!<br>

flvector-&gt;list<br>

list-&gt;flvector<br>

flvector-copy</tt>
<p>The <tt>flsingle</tt> operation drops precision from a flonum so that
the result is representable as a single-precision (32-bit) flonum.
Wrapping each operation of flonum arithmetic with <tt>flsingle</tt>
produces the same result as single-precision arithmetic, and local
unboxing plus type inference makes the combination reasonably
efficient.

<p>
Flonum printing can be controlled by new parameters:

<p>

<p><tt>print-subnormal-precision<br>

print-positive-exponent-sign<br>

print-select-flonum-exponential-format</tt>
<p>The <tt>fl=</tt>, <tt>fl&lt;</tt>, , <tt>fl&gt;</tt>, <tt>fl&lt;=</tt>, and
<tt>fl&gt;=</tt> no longer produce <tt>#f</tt> for a single argument
that's <tt>+nan.0</tt>, which makes them consistent with <tt>=</tt>,
<tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>, and <tt>&gt;=</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g16"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h16"></a>2.15. Improved bignum arithmetic (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
Multiplication of very large numbers uses Karatsuba, Toom-3, or
Toom-4, while division (including GCD) uses Burnikel-Ziegler. These
changes make arithmetic and number-to-string conversions faster for
large values, and they avoid unbounded delays between interrupt
polling.

<p>

<a name="g17"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h17"></a>2.16. Exact zeros, transcendentals, and exponentials (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
Division of an exact <tt>0</tt> by an inexact number now always
produces exact <tt>0</tt>, and
division of an inexact number by an exact <tt>0</tt> now raises an
exception instead of producing <tt>+inf.0</tt> or <tt>-inf.0</tt>,
This change makes division more consistent with the existing behavior of
multiplication, where multiplication of an inexact number by an exact
<tt>0</tt> produces an exact <tt>0</tt>. It should be noted, however, that
this change takes <tt>/</tt> out of compliance with R6RS.

<p>
Small changes to transcendental functions help improve consistency for
derived compositions. The <tt>expt</tt> function with two
<tt>+inf.0</tt> or <tt>-inf.0</tt> arguments now produces
<tt>+nan.0+nan.0i</tt> instead of a complex number with infinite
components. The <tt>sqrt</tt> and <tt>log</tt> functions change so
that <tt>(sqrt&nbsp;-0.0)</tt> and <tt>(log&nbsp;-0.0)</tt> produce real
numbers, instead of complex numbers, on the grounds that
<tt>(negative?&nbsp;-0.0)</tt> produces <tt>#f</tt>.

<p>
The <tt>expt</tt> function recognizes an exact <tt>1/2</tt> as its
second argument, and in that case it behaves like <tt>sqrt</tt>, which
may produce an exact result.

<p>

<a name="g18"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h18"></a>2.17. New character, string, and Unicode functions (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
New functions support decoding grapheme clusters within strings or
character streams and expose the underlying new character classifiers:

<p>

<p><tt>string-grapheme-span<br>

string-grapheme-count<br>

char-grapheme-step<br>

char-grapheme-break-property<br>

char-extended-pictographic?</tt>
<p>The <tt>string-append-immutable</tt> function enables the creation of
an immutable string as the result of appending strings without
creating an intermediate mutable string.

<p>
The <tt>path-build</tt> procedure combines two path strings to form a
path, adding a directory separator between them if necessary.

<p>

<a name="g19"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h19"></a>2.18. Hashtable changes (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
Operations returning hashtable cells (<tt>hashtable-cell</tt>,
<tt>eq-hashtable-cell</tt>, <tt>symbol-hashtable-cell</tt>, and
<tt>hashtable-cells</tt>) now raise an exception when given an immutable
hashtable.  This is an <i>incompatible change</i>, as they previously
accepted immutable hashtables (and allowed changing them).

<p>
The <tt>make-weak-hashtable</tt> and <tt>make-ephemeron-hashtable</tt>
functions support weak and ephemeron hash tables with arbitrary
equality and hashing functions.


<p>
New operations for hashtable cells resemble procedures like
<tt>hashtable-keys</tt> or <tt>hashtable-ref</tt>:

<p>

<p><tt>hashtable-cells<br>

hashtable-ref-cell<br>

eq-hashtable-ref-cell<br>

symbol-hashtable-ref-cell</tt>
<p>The <tt>eq-hashtable-try-atomic-cell</tt> procedure supports lock-free
use of an <tt>eq?</tt>-based hash table, but with constraints on
concurrent operations and resizing. Clean-up resizing can be performed
within a collect-request handler, since only one thread can run at that
time.

<p>
A weak or ephemeron <tt>eqv?</tt> hash table now retains non-fixnum
numbers only weakly, instead of strongly. This change is related to
changes to <tt>eq?</tt> for flonum values and the availability of weak
and ephemeron hash tables with arbitrary equality and hashing
functions.

<p>

<a name="g20"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h20"></a>2.19. Stencil vectors (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
Stencil vectors provide support in the compiler and runtime for
implementing data structures such as persistent maps:

<p>

<p><tt>stencil-vector<br>

stencil-vector?<br>

stencil-vector-mask<br>

stencil-vector-length<br>

stencil-vector-ref<br>

stencil-vector-set!<br>

stencil-vector-update<br>

stencil-vector-truncate!<br>

stencil-vector-mask-width</tt>
<p>
<a name="g21"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h21"></a>2.20. New vector functions (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
New and extended (in the case of <tt>vector-copy</tt>) vector functions
support creating a vector from the content of others and creating immutable
vectors:

<p>

<p><tt>vector-copy<br>

vector-append<br>

vector-set/copy<br>

immutable-vector<br>

immutable-vector-copy<br>

immutable-vector-append<br>

immutable-vector-set/copy</tt>
<p>Although the mutable-vector variants of these functions could be
implemented with <tt>make-vector</tt> and <tt>vector-set!</tt>, the
new versions can avoid redundant initialization and write barriers.
The immutable-vector functions similarly can avoid allocating an
intermediate mutable vector.

<p>

<a name="g22"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h22"></a>2.21. New symbol functions (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
While gensyms support most symbol-generation needs, uninterned symbols
are useful for purposes where properties must not prevent a symbol
from being reclaimed by the storage manager:

<p>

<p><tt>string-&gt;uninterned-symbol<br>

uninterned-symbol?</tt>
<p>The string returned by <tt>symbol-&gt;string</tt> is always immutable.

<p>

<a name="g23"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h23"></a>2.22. Record anonymous fields (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
Records can have anonymous fields, which can save memory in the
representation when many record types need to be created (as opposed
to many record instances of a few types), each with many fields. For a
given record type and its ancestors, either all fields are named or
all fields are anonymous.

<p>

<p><tt>make-record-type-descriptor*<br>

record-type-named-fields?<br>

record-type-field-indices</tt>
<p>The new <tt>record-instance?</tt> predicate is a specialization of
<tt>record?</tt>, where the first argument is required to be a record.
An unsafe <tt>record-instance?</tt> test can be faster than an unsafe

<p>
In a context where pairs are not mutated, the new
<tt>list-assuming-immutable?</tt> predicate is useful as a variant of
the <tt>list?</tt> predicate. The new predicate implements an
efficient, amortized constant-time decision on whether a value
represents a list, but its behavior is unspecified if the
<tt>cdr</tt> or any pair relevant to the result is mutated.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h26"></a>2.25. Wrapper procedures (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
A <i>wrapper procedure</i> provides an inexpensive way to an adjust a
procedure's name, constrain its arity, or associate extra data to the
procedure. A wrapper procedure is implemented as closure with an
optimized jump to the wrapped procedure after arity checking,
propagating the original arguments faster than <tt>apply</tt>.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h27"></a>2.26. New thread functions (10.0.0)</h4>


<a name="sec:threads"></a>

<p>
The new <tt>thread-join</tt> operator can be used to wait for a thread
to terminate. Waiting for termination in this sense can be useful to
ensure that a single thread is running and calling <tt>collect</tt> is
legal, for example.

<p>
The new <tt>get-initial-thread</tt> procedure returns a descriptor for
the initial thread (like a descriptor produced by <tt>fork-thread</tt>
for a subsequently created thread).

<p>
The new <tt>thread-preserve-ownership!</tt> procedure provides a hint
to the storage manager that parallel garbage collection is likely to
benefit by keeping track of which objects were allocated by a given
thread.

<p>
Useful on architectures with a weak consistency model,
<tt>memory-order-acquire</tt> and <tt>memory-order-release</tt>
implement fencing operators suitable for abstractions that acquire
(load-load and load-store fence) or release (store-store and
store-load fence) shared resources.

<p>
When a new thread is created, it now starts with the default
exception-handler stack instead of inheriting the stack of the
creating thread.

<p>

<a name="g28"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h28"></a>2.27. Garbage collection introspection (10.0.0)</h4>


<a name="sec:gc-reflect"></a>

<p>
Similar to <tt>enable-object-counts</tt>, the
<tt>enable-object-backreferences</tt> parameter enables recording of
information about reachability. After a collection with backreferences
enabled, <tt>object-backreferences</tt> reports an association for
each object to the a referencing object---one that caused the storage
manager to consider the former object reachable.

<p>
A new <tt>bytes-finalized</tt> procedure reports the number of bytes
that have been finalized via guardians, which is useful for deciding
when to perform an extra major collection as a follow-up to an
old-generation garbage collection.

<p>
A <i>phantom bytevector</i> is a small object that stands for a large
externally allocated object, especially one that can be finalized.
Registering external allocations with the storage manager helps it
trigger collection requests at times that take into account the rate
and scale of external allocation.

<p>

<p><tt>make-phantom-bytevector<br>

phantom-bytevector?<br>

phantom-bytevector-length<br>

set-phantom-bytevector-length!</tt>
<p>The new <tt>compute-size-increments</tt> procedure is similar to
<tt>compute-size</tt>. Instead of a single object, it takes a list of
objects, and it reports a list of sizes where any memory use
attributed to objects earlier in the list is not counted for objects
later in the list, while objects later the list are not considered
reachable by objects earlier in the list. For example, given a list of
threads, <tt>compute-size-increments</tt> effectively treats each
thread as an accounting domain, where memory is charged to an earlier
thread rather than a later thread when objects are reachable from
both. Since this computation involves the same sort of traversal as a
garbage collection, the <tt>collect</tt> function takes a list as
an optional last argument to fuse a garbage collection with size
accounting.

<p>

<a name="g29"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h29"></a>2.28. Storage management and foreign interfaces (10.0.0)</h4>


<a name="sec:ffi-storage"></a>

<p>
The <tt>make-guardian</tt> function accepts an option to create an
<i>ordered guardian</i>. An ordered guardian treats each of its
objects as accessible in the case that object is reachable from a
guardian-registered object, whether or not the latter object is
considered accessible. Ordered finalization is error-prone and cannot
handle reference cycles, but it can be necessary to implement certain
storage-management interfaces and abstractions.

<p>
An <i>immobile object</i> is one that the storage manager will not
relocate as a long as it is referenced, in the same way that a locked
object is never relocated. Unlike a locked object, an immobile
object can be reclaimed by the storage manager.

<p>

<p><tt>box-immobile<br>

make-immobile-vector<br>

make-immobile-bytevector</tt>
<p>For foreign interfaces that involve arrays of references to allocated
objects, the storage manager supports <i>reference
bytevectors</i>. A reference bytevector is a bytevector, but each
word-aligned group of bytes is treated as a potential reference to an
object managed by the collector; only a word whose value corresponds a
region of managed memory is treated as an object reference, and it can
be updated by the garbage collector if the referenced object is
relocated. Using the reference-bytevector interface requires care, but
it can greatly simplify certain foreign-library interactions. An
object reference in a bytevector takes the form of a <i>reference
address</i> for a Scheme object.  The reference address of a bytevector
(including a reference bytevector) or flvector is the address of the
first byte of its content.

<p>

<p><tt>make-reference-bytevector<br>

<p>The <tt>keep-live</tt> procedure accepts any value and returns
<tt>(void)</tt>, but the argument to <tt>keep-live</tt> is defined to
be reachable until the call to <tt>keep-live</tt> returns.

<p>
The maximum non-static generation for collection has been reduced from
254 to 6. This change is related to parallel garbage collection and
internal changes that make allocation thread-local, which in turn
makes the size of a thread's representation proportional to the
maximum number of generations.

<p>

<a name="g30"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h30"></a>2.29. Foreign interface extensions (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
Some ABIs treat functions with varargs (i.e., specified with
<tt>...</tt> in the C prototype) differently than functions without
varargs, and some ABIs treat specific arguments differently depending
on whether the argument is a vararg (i.e., before the <tt>...</tt> or
not). A procedure type described with <tt>foreign-procedure</tt> or a
<tt>function</tt> type can include a <tt>__varargs</tt> or
<tt>(__varargs_after&nbsp;<i>n</i>)</tt> convention to indicate which
arguments of a function are varargs.

<p>
The new <tt>foreign-alignof</tt> procedure reflects alignment
information for a primitive type.

<p>
To better support the pb machine type, where endianness is not known
statically, endianness in a foreign type can not be <tt>native</tt> or
<tt>swapped</tt> in addition to <tt>big</tt> or <tt>little</tt>.

<p>
Chez Scheme's kernel also expose record-type and field access to
C, mainly useful for for records that contain only pointer-sized
values:

<p>

<p><tt>Srecord_type<br>

Srecord_type_parent<br>

Srecord_type_size<br>

Srecord_type_uniformp<br>

Srecord_uniform_ref</tt>
<p>The kernel also provides a new function
<tt>Sregister_boot_file_fd_segment</tt> for loading a boot file from a
file descriptor and offset. This form of boot-file registration is
useful for loading boot files that are embedded with an executable
segment.

<p>

<a name="g31"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h31"></a>2.30. Fasl and vfasl (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
Reading fasl data has been made safe no matter how deeply nested the
structure of the data.

<p>
For reading and writing fasl data, the <tt>fasl-write</tt> procedure
accepts a predicate to detect "external" values for which only a
placeholder is saved, and <tt>fasl-read</tt> accepts a table of
external values to substitute for placeholders. These "external"
values can then have their own serialization and deserialization. The
<tt>fasl-write</tt> function also accepts an option to save a record
type as only its unique ID, which can save space and time in contexts
where the relevant record types will always be available already (and
where savings are worth skipping a consistency check). The
<tt>compile-to-port</tt> procedure accepts new arguments like
<tt>fasl-write</tt>.

<p>
A fasl stream can be converted a <i>vfasl</i> (very fasl) format,
which is close in structure to an image of data in memory. Using vfasl
for boot files to load directly into a static generation can make
startup much faster; otherwise, the time-space tradeoff rarely pays
off. Convert from fasl to vfasl using <tt>vfasl-convert-file</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g32"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h32"></a>2.31. New compiler options (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
Two new parameters skip safety checks in specific situations:
<tt>enable-unsafe-application</tt> assumes that the target of a
procedure application is a procedure, and
<tt>enable-unsafe-variable-reference</tt> assumes that a variable has
a value when it is referenced. These checks would be skipped at
<tt>optimize-level</tt> 3, but the parameters cause them to be skipped
independent of the value of <tt>optimize-level</tt>.

<p>
A true value for the <tt>enable-arithmetic-left-associative</tt>
parameter ensures that arithmetic operations are performed as
left-associative, which amounts to a constraint on optimizations.

<p>
A new set of parameters control the way that libraries are compiled
and invoked so that consistency checks, invocations checks, and
recompilations can be skipped (to save time and space) in a context
that ensures that they are unnecessary:

<p>

<p><tt>library-timestamp-mode<br>

expand-omit-library-invocations<br>

compile-omit-concatenate-support</tt>
<p>Along those lines, the <tt>current-generate-id</tt> parameter provides
control over names that are generated during macro expansion. While
the default parameter uses <tt>gensym</tt>, name generation can
potentially be made deterministic, which in turn may reduce the need
to recompile clients.

<p>
The new <tt>procedure-known-single-valued?</tt> predicate is always
allowed to return <tt>#f</tt>, but it may return <tt>#t</tt> for a
procedure that the compiler was able to prove always returns a single
value. This information may, in turn, be useful for run-time
specialization in a library.

<p>
Procedure objects recognize the <tt>realm</tt> inspector message
alongside <tt>name</tt>. The result for <tt>realm</tt> is normally
<tt>#f</tt>, but if <tt>compile-procedure-realm</tt> is set to a
symbol when the procedure is compiled, then the procedure answers
<tt>realm</tt> with that symbol. The intent of a realm is that it
describes where a procedure name came from, so the name can be
converted as appropriate for a run-time context that uses different
naming conventions.

<p>
The <tt>enable-error-source-expression</tt> parameter determines
whether error messages that become embedded in code can refer to the
original source file's path.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h33"></a>2.32. Executable-relative boot files (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
When searching for boot files, the two-character escape sequence
"<tt>%x</tt>" is now supported on more platforms. By default, Chez
Scheme is configured to use this facility to find boot files relative
to the executable, even when installed.

<p>

<a name="g34"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h34"></a>2.33. Syntax quoting (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
The new <tt>quote-syntax</tt> form is like the R<sup>6</sup>RS <tt>syntax</tt>
form except that pattern variables are not substituted.  It can be
useful for macro transformers that need to embed syntax objects based
on the input in the output.

<a name="g35"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h35"></a>2.34. New conversions from Scheme to C signed and unsigned integers (9.6.4)</h4>




<p>
The following new functions
allow foreign code to try converting Scheme
values to signed or unsigned integer values
without triggering a <tt>longjmp</tt> in the Scheme runtime
as can happen when calling the corresponding functions
<tt>Sinteger_value</tt>, etc:

<p><tt>Stry_integer_value<br>

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h36"></a>2.35. New types for code that uses C exports (9.6.4)</h4>




<p>
The header file scheme.h distributed with Chez Scheme now defines
<tt>Sint32_t</tt>, <tt>Suint32_t</tt>, <tt>Sint64_t</tt>, and <tt>Suint64_t</tt>
types for 32-bit and 64-bit signed and unsigned integers that are compatible

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h37"></a>2.36. New transcoded port buffer-size parameters (9.6.0)</h4>




<p>
The new parameter <tt>transcoded-port-buffer-size</tt> specifies the size
of the string buffer that is allocated when creating a new transcoded port.
If the underlying binary port implements <tt>port-position</tt>,
a transcoded input port allocates an internal fxvector the same size
as its string buffer for use by <tt>port-position</tt>.
The new parameter <tt>make-codec-buffer</tt> can be used to supply an appropriately
sized internal bytevector buffer for the codec used by a new transcoded port.
The size of these string and bytevector buffers was previously hardcoded at 1024.

<p>

<a name="g38"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h38"></a>2.37. Unicode 15.0 support (9.6.0)</h4>




<p>
The character sets, character classes, and word-breaking algorithms for character, string,
and Unicode-related bytevector operations have now been updated to Unicode 15.0.

<p>

<a name="g39"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h39"></a>2.38. Basic ftypes can be referenced, even if shadowed by syntactic binding (9.5.8)</h4>




<p>
Previously, it was possible to interfere with the definition of ftypes by
creating a syntactic binding for one of the built-in types, such as
<tt>integer-32</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, etc.
As of 9.5.8, syntactic bindings that do not bind an ftype descriptor are no
longer considered when defining ftypes.

<p>
This change also allows a base ftype to be bound using <tt>define-ftype</tt>, though
this fixes the endianness of the type.  For instance:

<p>

<p><tt>(define-ftype&nbsp;integer-32&nbsp;integer-32)</tt>
<p>This binds the ftype <tt>integer-32</tt> to the native-endian <tt>integer-32</tt>.  It is possible to bind both endiannesses by using explicit names:

<p>

<p><tt>(define-ftype&nbsp;integer-32-be&nbsp;(endian&nbsp;big&nbsp;integer-32))<br>

(define-ftype&nbsp;integer-32-le&nbsp;(endian&nbsp;little&nbsp;integer-32))<br>

(define-ftype&nbsp;integer-32&nbsp;integer-32)&nbsp;;;&nbsp;fixed&nbsp;to&nbsp;native&nbsp;endianness</tt>

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h40"></a>2.39. Improved error messages (9.5.6)</h4>




<p>
When the reader reports an invalid bytevector element, the error
message now includes the token value only if the token type is atomic.

<p>
When the expander reports that an ellipsis is missing in a syntax form,
it now includes the name of an identifier that is missing an ellipsis
within that form.

<p>

<a name="g41"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h41"></a>2.40. Additional reader syntax for booleans (9.5.6)</h4>




<p>
The reader now case-insensitively accepts <tt>#true</tt> and
<tt>#false</tt> as alternative spellings of the booleans <tt>#t</tt>
and <tt>#f</tt>, respectively.

<p>

<a name="g42"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h42"></a>2.41. Self-evaluating vector literals (9.5.6)</h4>




<p>
The new parameter <tt>self-evaluating-vectors</tt> can be used to treat unquoted vector
literals as self-evaluating instead of syntax errors. This parameter is turned off by
default.

<p>

<a name="g43"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h43"></a>2.42. Incremental promotion of collected objects (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
In previous versions of <i>Chez Scheme</i>, the collector always promoted
surviving objects from every collected generation into a single
target generation.
For example, when the target generation was 3, it promoted not only
surviving objects from generation 2 to generation 3 but also surviving
objects from generations 0 and 1 directly to generation 3.
This caused some prematurely promoted objects to be subjected to
collection less frequently than their ages justified, potentially
resulting in substantial inappropriate storage retention.
This is particularly problematic when side effects result in pointers
from the inappropriately retained objects to younger objects, as
can happen with nonfunctional queues and lazy streams.

<p>
Unless directed to do otherwise, the collector now promotes objects
up only one generation at a time.
That is, generation 0 objects that survive collection are promoted
to generation 1, generation 1 objects are promoted to generation
2, and so on.
(Objects that survive a maximum nonstatic collection are promoted
back into the maximum nonstatic collection.)
Most applications should exhibit lower peak memory usage and possibly
lower run times with this change.
Applications that are adversely affected, if any, might benefit
from a custom collect-request handler or custom values for the
collection parameters that affect the behavior of the default
handler.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h44"></a>2.43. Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane console I/O in Windows (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
Console I/O now supports characters from the Unicode Basic
Multilingual Plane in Windows. Windows consoles do not yet support the
supplementary planes.

<p>

<a name="g45"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h45"></a>2.44. Incompatible fasl-format and compiled-file compression changes (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
The fasl (fast-load) format now supports per-object compression.
Whether the fasl writer actually performs compression is determined
by the new <tt>fasl-compressed</tt> parameter, whose value defaults
to <tt>#t</tt>.
The compression format and level are determined by the
<tt>compress-format</tt> and <tt>compress-level</tt>
parameters.

<p>
The <tt>compile-compressed</tt> parameter has been eliminated.
Since compiled files are written in fasl format, the
<tt>fasl-compressed</tt> parameter also now controls whether compiled
files are compressed.

<p>
Because individual portions of a fasl file are already compressed
by default, attempting to compress a fasl file as a whole is often
ineffective as well as inefficient both when writing and reading
fasl objects.
Thus, in particular, the <tt><i>output-port</i></tt> and <tt>wpo-port</tt>
supplied to <tt>compile-port</tt> and <tt>compile-to-port</tt>
should not be opened for compression.
Similarly, external tools should not expect compiled files to be
compressed as a whole, nor should they compress compiled files.

<p>
Because compression of fasl files was previously encouraged and is
now discouraged, the first attempt to write fasl data to or read
fasl data from a compressed port will cause a warning to be issued,
i.e., an exception with condition type <tt>&amp;warning</tt> to be
raised.

<p>
The rationale for this change is to allow the fasl reader to seek
past, without reading, portions of an object file that contain
compile-time code at run time and run-time code at compile time.

<p>

<a name="g46"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h46"></a>2.45. Bytevector compression and compression level (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
The procedure <tt>bytevector-compress</tt> now selects the level of
compression based on the <tt>compress-level</tt> parameter.
Prior to this it always used a default setting for compression.

<p>
The <tt>compress-level</tt> parameter can now take on the new value
<tt>minimum</tt> in addition to <tt>low</tt>, <tt>medium</tt>,
<tt>high</tt>, and <tt>maximum</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g47"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h47"></a>2.46. Combining object files (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
In previous versions of Chez Scheme, multiple object files could
be combined by concatenating them into a single file.  To support faster
object file loading and loadability verification (described later in this
document), recompile information and information about libraries and
top-level programs within an object file is now placed at the top of the
file.  The new <tt>concatenate-object-files</tt> procedure can be used to
combine multiple object files while moving this information to the
top of the combined file.

<p>

<a name="g48"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h48"></a>2.47. Explicitly invoking libraries (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
The new procedure <tt>invoke-library</tt> can be used to force
the evaluation of a library's body expressions (variable definition
right-hand sides and initialization expressions) before they might
otherwise be needed.
It is generally useful only for libraries whose body expressions
have side effects.

<p>

<a name="g49"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h49"></a>2.48. Verifying loadability of libraries and programs (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
The new procedure <tt>verify-loadability</tt> can be used to
determine, without actually loading any object code or defining any
libraries, whether a set of object files and the object files
satisfying their library dependencies, direct or indirect, are
present, readable, and mutually compatible.

<p>
To support loadability verification, information about libraries
and top-level programs within an object file is now placed at the
top of the file, just after recompile information.  This change can
be detected by unusual setups, e.g., a source file that interleaves
library definitions and top-level forms that call library-list, but
is backward compatible for standard use cases in which each file
contains one or more libraries possibly followed by a top-level
program.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h50"></a>2.49. Unregistering objects from guardians (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
The set of as-yet unresurrected objects registered with a guardian
can be unregistered and retrieved by means of the new primitive
<tt>unregister-guardian</tt>.
Consult the user's guide for usage and caveats.
Guardians can now be distinguished from other procedures (and other
objects) via the new primitive <tt>guardian?</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g51"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h51"></a>2.50. Coverage support and source tables (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
When the new parameter <tt>generate-covin-files</tt> is set to <tt>#t</tt>
rather than the default <tt>#f</tt>, file compilation routines such as
<tt>compile-file</tt> and <tt>compile-library</tt> produce coverage
information (<tt>.covin</tt>) files that can be used in conjunction with
profile information to measure coverage of a source-code base.
Coverage information is also written out when the optional <tt><i>covop</i></tt>
argument is supplied to <tt>compile-port</tt> and <tt>compile-to-port</tt>.

<p>
A covin file contains a printed representation of a <i>source
table</i> mapping each profiled source object in the code base to a
count of zero.
Source tables generally associate source objects with arbitrary values
and are allocated and manipulated with hashtable-like operations specific
to source tables.

<p>
Profile information can be tracked even through releasing and clearing
of profile counters via the new procedure <tt>with-profile-tracker</tt>,
which produces a source table.

<p>
Coverage of a source-code base can thus be achieved by comparing
the set of source objects in the covin-file source tables for one
or more source files with the set of source objects in the source
tables produced by one or more runs of tests run with profile
information tracked by <tt>with-profile-tracker</tt>.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h52"></a>2.51. Importing a library from an object file now visits the file (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
As described in Section&nbsp;<a href="./release_notes.html#g239">4.4</a>,
importing a library from an object file now causes the object file
to be visited rather than fully loaded.
If the run-time information is needed, i.e., if the library is
invoked, the file will be revisited.
This is typically transparent to the program, but problems can arise
if the program changes its current directory (via
<tt>current-directory</tt>) prior to invoking a library, and the
object file cannot be found.

<p>

<a name="g53"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h53"></a>2.52. Recompile information (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
As described in Section&nbsp;<a href="./release_notes.html#g239">4.4</a>, all
recompile information is now placed at the front of each object
file where it can be read without the need to scan through the
remainder of the file.
Because the library manager expects to find recompile information
at the front of an object file, it will not find all recompile
information if object files are concatenated together via some
mechanism other than then new <tt>concatenate-object-files</tt>
procedure.

<p>
Also, the compiler has to hold in memory the object code for all
expressions in a file so that it can emit the unified recompile
information, rather than writing to the object file incrementally,
which can significantly increase the memory required to compile a
large file full of individual top-level forms.
This does not affect top-level programs, which were already handled
as a whole, or a typical library file that contains just a single
library form.

<p>

<a name="g54"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h54"></a>2.53. Optional new <tt>fasl-read</tt> situation argument (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
It is now possible to direct <tt>fasl-read</tt> to read only visit
(compile-time) or revisit (run-time) objects via the optional new
situation argument.
Situation <tt>visit</tt> causes the fasl reader to skip over
revisit (run-time-only) objects, while
<tt>revisit</tt> causes the fasl reader to skip over
visit (compile-time-only) objects.
Situation <tt>load</tt> doesn't skip over any objects.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h55"></a>2.54. Optional <tt>read-token</tt> <tt><i>sfd</i></tt> and <tt><i>bfp</i></tt> arguments (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
In addition to the optional input-port argument, <tt>read-token</tt> now takes
optional <tt><i>sfd</i></tt> (source-file-descriptor) and <tt><i>bfp</i></tt> (beginning-file-position)
arguments.
If either is provided, both must be provided.
Specifying <tt><i>sfd</i></tt> and <tt><i>bfp</i></tt> improves the quality of error messages,
guarantees the <tt>read-token</tt> <tt><i>start</i></tt> and <tt><i>end</i></tt> return values can be determined,
and eliminates the overhead of asking for a file position on each call
to <tt>read-token</tt>.
<tt><i>bfp</i></tt> is normally 0 for the first call
to <tt>read-token</tt> at the start of a file,
and the <tt><i>end</i></tt> return value of the preceding
call for each subsequent call.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h56"></a>2.55. Compression format and level (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
Support for LZ4 compression has been added.
LZ4 is now the default format when compressing files (including
object files produced by the compiler) and bytevectors, while <tt>gzip</tt> is still supported and can be enabled by setting
the new <tt>compress-format</tt> parameter to the symbol <tt>gzip</tt> instead of the
default <tt>lz4</tt>.  Reading in compressed mode
infers the format, so reading <tt>gzip</tt>-compressed files will still
work without changing <tt>compress-format</tt>.  Reading LZ4-format
files tends to be much faster than reading <tt>gzip</tt>-format files,
while <tt>gzip</tt>-compressed files tend to be smaller.
In particular, object files created by the compiler now tend to be
larger but load more quickly.

<p>
The new <tt>compress-level</tt> parameter can be used to control
the amount of time spent on file and bytevector compression.
It can be set to one of the symbols <tt>minimum</tt>, <tt>low</tt>,
<tt>medium</tt>, <tt>high</tt>, and <tt>maximum</tt>, which are
listed in order from shortest to longest compression time and least
to greatest effectiveness.
The default value is <tt>medium</tt>.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h57"></a>2.56. Mutexes and condition variables can have names (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
The procedures <tt>make-mutex</tt> and <tt>make-condition</tt> now
accept an optional argument <tt>name</tt>, which must be a symbol
that identifies the object or <tt>#f</tt> for no name. The name is
printed every time the mutex or condition object is printed, which
is useful for debugging.

<p>

<a name="g58"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h58"></a>2.57. Improved packaging support (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
The Chez Scheme <tt>Makefile</tt> has been enhanced with new targets for
creating binary packages for Unix-like operating systems.
The <tt>create-tarball</tt> target generates a binary tarball package for
distribution, the <tt>create-rpm</tt> target generates a Linux RPM package, and
the <tt>create-pkg</tt> target generates a macOS package file.

<p>

<a name="g59"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h59"></a>2.58. Library search handler (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
The new <tt>library-search-handler</tt> parameter controls how library source
or object code is located when <tt>import</tt>, <tt>compile-whole-program</tt>,
or <tt>compile-whole-library</tt> are used to load a library.
The value of the <tt>library-search-handler</tt> parameter must be a procedure
expecting four arguments: the <tt><i>who</i></tt> argument is a symbol that provides
context in <tt>import-notify</tt> messages, the <tt><i>library</i></tt> argument is the
name of the desired library, the <tt><i>directories</i></tt> is a list of source and
object directory pairs in the form returned by <tt>library-directories</tt>,
and the <tt><i>extensions</i></tt> parameter is a list of source and object extension
pairs in the form returned by <tt>library-extensions</tt>.
The default value of the <tt>library-search-handler</tt> is the newly exposed
<tt>default-library-search-handler</tt> procedure.

<p>

<a name="g60"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h60"></a>2.59. Ftype guardians (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
Applications that manage memory outside the Scheme heap can leverage
new support for ftype guardians to help perform reference counting.
An ftype guardian is like an ordinary guardian except that it does
not necessarily save from collection each ftype pointer registered
with it but instead decrements (atomically) a reference count at
the head of the object to which the ftype pointer points.
If the reference count becomes zero as a result of the decrement,
it preserves the object so that it can be retrieved from the guardian
and freed; otherwise it allows it to be collected.

<p>

<a name="g61"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h61"></a>2.60. Recompile information and whole-program optimization (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
<tt>compile-whole-program</tt> and <tt>compile-whole-library</tt>
now propagate recompile information from the named <tt>wpo</tt>
file to the object file to support <tt>maybe-compile-program</tt>
and <tt>maybe-compile-library</tt> in the case where the new object
file overwrites the original object file.

<p>

<a name="g62"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h62"></a>2.61. Directly accessing the value of compile-time values (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
The value of a compile-time value created by <tt>make-compile-time-value</tt>
can be retrieved via the new procedure <tt>compile-time-value-value</tt>.
The new predicate <tt>compile-time-value?</tt> can be used to determine if
an object is a compile-time value.

<p>

<a name="g63"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h63"></a>2.62. Extracting a subset of hashtable entries (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
The new <tt>hashtable-cells</tt> function is similar to
<tt>hashtable-entries</tt>, but it returns a vector of cells instead
of two vectors. An optional argument to <tt>hashtable-keys</tt>,
<tt>hashtable-values</tt>, <tt>hashtable-entries</tt>, or <tt>hashtable-cells</tt>
limits the size of the result vector.

<p>

<a name="g64"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h64"></a>2.63. Profile data retained for reclaimed code (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
Profile data is now retained indefinitely even for code objects
that have been reclaimed by the garbage collector.
Previously, the counters holding the data were reclaimed by the
collector along with the code objects.
This makes profile output more complete and accurate, but it does
represent a potential space leak in programs that create or load
and release code dynamically.
Such programs can avoid the potential space leak by releasing the
counters explicitly via the new procedure
<tt>profile-release-counters</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g65"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h65"></a>2.64. Procedure source location without inspector information (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
When <tt>generate-inspector-information</tt> is set to <tt>#f</tt> and
<tt>generate-procedure-source-information</tt> is set to <tt>#t</tt>,
source location information is preserved for a procedure, even though
other inspector information is not preserved.

<p>

<a name="g66"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h66"></a>2.65. Atomic compare-and-set (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
The new procedures <tt>box-cas!</tt> and <tt>vector-cas!</tt>
atomically update a box or vector with a given new value when the
current content is <tt>eq?</tt> to a given old value. Atomicity is
guaranteed even if multiple threads attempt to update the same box or
vector.

<p>

<a name="g67"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h67"></a>2.66. Foreign-procedure thread activation (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
A new <tt>__collect_safe</tt> foreign-procedure convention, which can
be combined with other conventions, causes a foreign-procedure call to
deactivate the current thread during the call so that other threads can
perform a garbage collection. Similarly, the <tt>__collect_safe</tt>
convention modifier for callables causes the current thread to be
activated on entry to the callable, and the activation state is
reverted on exit from the callable; this activation makes callables
work from threads that are otherwise unknown to the Scheme system.

<p>

<a name="g68"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h68"></a>2.67. Garbage collection and threads (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
A new <tt>collect-rendezvous</tt> function performs a garbage
collection in the same way as when the system determines that a
collection should occur. For many purposes,
<tt>collect-rendezvous</tt> is a variant of <tt>collect</tt> that
works when multiple threads are active. More precisely, the
<tt>collect-rendezvous</tt> function invokes the collect-request
handler (in an unspecified thread) after synchronizing all active
threads and temporarily deactivating all but the one used to call the
collect-request handler.

<p>

<a name="g69"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h69"></a>2.68. Foreign-procedure struct arguments and results (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
A new <tt>(&amp;&nbsp;<i>ftype</i>)</tt> form allows a struct or union to be
passed between Scheme and a foreign procedure. The Scheme-side
representation of a <tt>(&amp;&nbsp;<i>ftype</i>)</tt> argument is the
same as a <tt>(*&nbsp;<i>ftype</i>)</tt> argument, but where
<tt>(&amp;&nbsp;<i>ftype</i>)</tt> passes an address between the Scheme and C
worlds, <tt>(&amp;&nbsp;<i>ftype</i>)</tt> passes a copy of the data at the
address. When <tt>(&amp;&nbsp;<i>ftype</i>)</tt> is used as a result type,
an extra <tt>(*&nbsp;<i>ftype</i>)</tt> argument must be provided to receive
the copied result, and the directly returned result is unspecified.

<p>

<a name="g70"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h70"></a>2.69. Record equality and hashing (9.5, 9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
Several new procedures and parameters allow a program to control what
<tt>equal?</tt> and <tt>equal-hash</tt> do when applied
to structures containing record instances.
The procedures <tt>record-type-equal-procedure</tt> and
<tt>record-type-hash-procedure</tt> can be used to customize the
handling of records of specific types by <tt>equal?</tt> and <tt>hash</tt>, and
the procedures <tt>record-equal-procedure</tt> and
<tt>record-hash-procedure</tt> can be used to look up the
applicable (possibly inherited) equality and hashing procedures
for specific record instances.
The parameters <tt>default-record-equal-procedure</tt> and
<tt>default-record-hash-procedure</tt> can be used to control
the default behavior when comparing or hashing records without
type-specific equality and hashing procedures.

<p>

<a name="g71"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h71"></a>2.70. Immutable vectors, fxvectors, bytevectors, strings, and boxes (9.5)</h4>




<p>
Support for immutable vectors, fxvectors, bytevectors, strings, and boxes
has been added.
Immutable vectors are created via <tt>vector-&gt;immutable-vector</tt>,
and immutable fxvectors, bytevectors, and strings are created by similarly named
procedures.
Immutable boxes are created via <tt>box-immutable</tt>.
Any attempt to modify an immutable object causes an exception to be raised.

<p>

<a name="g72"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h72"></a>2.71. Ephemeron pairs and hashtables (9.5)</h4>




<p>
Support for ephemeron pairs has been added, along with eq and eqv
hashtables that use ephemeron pairs to combine keys and values. An
ephemeron pair avoids the "key in value" problem of weak pairs,
where a weakly held key is paired to a value that refers back to the
key, in which case the key remains reachable as long as the pair is
reachable. In an ephemeron pair, the cdr of the pair is not considered
reachable by the garbage collector until both the pair and the car of
the pair have been found reachable. An ephemeron hashtable implements
a weak mapping where referencing a key in a value does not prevent the
mapping from being removed from the table.

<p>

<a name="g73"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h73"></a>2.72. Optional timeout for <tt>condition-wait</tt> (9.5)</h4>




<p>
The <tt>condition-wait</tt> procedure now takes an optional
<tt><i>timeout</i></tt> argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the
thread was awakened by the condition before the timeout. The
<tt><i>timeout</i></tt> can be a time record of type <tt>time-duration</tt> or
<tt>time-utc</tt>, or it can be <tt>#f</tt> for no timeout (the
default).

<p>

<a name="g74"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h74"></a>2.73. <tt>date-dst?</tt> and <tt>date-zone-name</tt> (9.5)</h4>




<p>
The new primitive procedures <tt>date-dst?</tt> and
<tt>date-zone-name</tt> access time-zone information for a
<tt>date</tt> record that is created without an explicit
zone offset. The zone-offset argument to <tt>make-date</tt>
is now optional.

<p>

<a name="g75"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h75"></a>2.74. <tt>procedure-arity-mask</tt> (9.5)</h4>




<p>
The new primitive procedure <tt>procedure-arity-mask</tt> takes a
procedure <tt><i>p</i></tt> and returns a two's complement bitmask representing
the argument counts accepted by <tt><i>p</i></tt>.
For example, the arity mask for a two-argument procedure such as
<tt><i>cons</i></tt> is 4 (only bit two set),
while the arity mask for a procedure that accepts one or more arguments,
such as <tt><i>list*</i></tt>, is -2 (all but bit 0 set).

<p>

<a name="g76"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h76"></a>2.75. Bytevector compression (9.5)</h4>




<p>
The new primitive procedures <tt>bytevector-compress</tt> and
<tt>bytevector-decompress</tt> exposes for bytevectors the kind of
compression functionality that is used for files with the
<tt>compressed</tt> option.

<p>

<a name="g77"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h77"></a>2.76. Line caching and source objects (9.5)</h4>




<p>
The <tt>locate-source</tt> function accepts an optional argument that
enables the use of a cache for line information, so that a source file
does not have to be consulted each time to compute line information.
To further avoid file and caching issues, a source object has optional
beginning-line and beginning-column components. Source objects with line
and column components take more space, but they allow reporting of line and column
information even if a source file is later modified or becomes unavailable.
The value of the <tt>current-make-source-object</tt> parameter is used by the
reader to construct source objects for programs, and the parameter can be
modified to collect line and column information eagerly. The value of the
<tt>current-locate-source-object-source</tt> parameter is used for
error reporting, instead of calling <tt>locate-source</tt> or
<tt>locate-source-object-source</tt> directly, so that just-in-time
source-location lookup can be adjusted, too.

<p>

<a name="g78"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h78"></a>2.77. High-precision clock time in Windows 8 and up (9.5)</h4>




<p>
When running on Windows 8 and up, Chez Scheme uses the high-precision
clock time function for the current date and time.

<p>

<a name="g79"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h79"></a>2.78. Printing of non-standard (extended) identifiers (9.5)</h4>




<p>
Chez Scheme extends the syntax of identifiers as described in the
introduction to the Chez Scheme User's Guide, except within forms prefixed
by <tt>#!r6rs</tt>, which is implied in a library or top-level program.
Prior to Version&nbsp;9.5, the printer always printed such identifiers using
hex scalar value escapes as necessary to render them with valid R6RS identifier syntax.
When the new parameter <tt>print-extended-identifiers</tt> is set
to <tt>#t</tt>, these identifiers are printed without escapes, e.g.,
<tt>1+</tt> prints as <tt>1+</tt> rather than as <tt>\x31;+</tt>.
The default value of this parameter is <tt>#f</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g80"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h80"></a>2.79. Expression-editor Unicode support (9.5)</h4>




<p>
The expression editor now supports Unicode characters under Linux and MacOS&nbsp;X
except that combining characters are not treated correctly for
line-wrapping.

<p>

<a name="g81"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h81"></a>2.80. Extensions to whole-program, whole-library optimization (9.3.1, 9.3.4)</h4>




<p>
<tt>compile-whole-program</tt> now supports incomplete
whole-program optimization, i.e., whole program optimization that
incorporates only libraries for which wpo files are available while
leaving separate libraries for which only object files are available.
In addition, imported libraries can be left visible for run-time
use by the <tt>environment</tt> procedure or for dynamically loaded
object files that might require them.
The new procedure <tt>compile-whole-library</tt> supports the combination
of groups of libraries separate from programs and unconditionally
leaves all imported libraries visible.

<a name="g82"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h82"></a>2.81. 24-, 40-, 48-, and 56-bit bit-field containers (9.3.3)</h4>




<p>
The total size of the fields within an ftype <tt>bits</tt> can now be
24, 40, 48, or 56 (as well as 8, 16, 32, and 64).

<p>

<a name="g83"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h83"></a>2.82. Object-counting for static-generation collections (9.3.3)</h4>




<p>
Object counting (see <tt>object-counts</tt> below) is now enabled for
all collections targeting the static generation.

<p>

<a name="g84"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h84"></a>2.83. Support for off-line profile-dump processing (9.3.2)</h4>




<p>
Previously, the output of <tt>profile-dump</tt> was not specified.
It is now specified to be a list of source-object, profile-count pairs.
In addition, <tt>profile-dump-html</tt>, <tt>profile-dump-list</tt>,
and <tt>profile-dump-data</tt> all now take an optional <tt><i>dump</i></tt>
argument, which is a list of source-object, profile-count pairs in
the form returned by <tt>profile-dump</tt> and defaults to the current
value of <tt>(profile-dump)</tt>.

<p>
With these changes, it is now possible to obtain a dump from
<tt>profile-dump</tt> in one process, and write it to a fasl file
(using <tt>fasl-write</tt>) for subsequent off-line processing in
another process, where it can be read from the fasl file (using
<tt>fasl-read</tt>) and processed using <tt>profile-dump-html</tt>,
<tt>profile-dump-list</tt>, <tt>profile-dump-data</tt> or some
custom mechanism.

<p>

<a name="g85"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h85"></a>2.84. More support for controlling return of memory to the O/S (9.3.2)</h4>




<p>
A new parameter, <tt>release-minimum-generation</tt>, determines when
the collector attempts to return unneeded virtual memory to the O/S.
It defaults to the value of <tt>collect-maximum-generation</tt>, so the
collector attempts to return memory to the O/S only when performing a
maximum-generation collection.
It can be set to a lower generation number to cause the collector to
do so for younger generations we well.

<p>

<a name="g86"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h86"></a>2.85. sstats changes (9.3.1)</h4>




<p>
The vector-based sstats structure has been replaced with a record type.
The time fields are all time objects, and the bytes and count fields
are now exact integers.
<tt>time-difference</tt> no longer coerces negative results to zero.

<p>

<a name="g87"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h87"></a>2.86. <tt>library-group</tt> eliminated (9.3.1)</h4>




<p>
With the extensions to <tt>compile-whole-program</tt> and the
addition of <tt>compile-whole-library</tt>, as described above,
support for whole-program and whole-library optimization now subsumes
the functionality of the experimental <tt>library-group</tt> form,
and the form has been eliminated.
This is an <i>incompatible change</i>.

<p>

<a name="g88"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h88"></a>2.87. Support for Version&nbsp;7 interaction-environment semantics eliminated (9.3.1)</h4>




<p>
Prior to Version&nbsp;8, the semantics of the interaction environment
used by the read-eval-print loop (REPL), aka waiter, and by
<tt>load</tt>, <tt>compile</tt>, and <tt>interpret</tt> without
explicit environment arguments treated all variables in the environment
as mutable, including those bound to primitives.
This meant that top-level references to primitive names could not
be optimized by the compiler because their values might change at
run time, except that, at optimize-level 2 and above, the compiler
did treat primitive names as always having their original values.

<p>
In Version 8 and subsequent versions, primitive bindings in the
interaction environment are immutable, as if imported directly from
the immutable Scheme environment.
That is, they cannot be assigned, although they can be replaced
with new bindings with a top-level definition.

<p>
To provide temporary backward compatibility, the
<tt>--revert-interaction-semantics</tt> command-line option and
<tt>revert-interaction-semantics</tt> parameter allowed programmers
to revert the interaction environment to Version&nbsp;7 semantics.
This functionality has now been eliminated and along with it the
special treatment of primitive bindings at optimize level 2 and
above.

<p>
This is an <i>incompatible change</i>.

<p>

<a name="g89"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h89"></a>2.88. Explicit specification of profile source locations (9.3.1)</h4>




<p>
Version 9.3.1 augments existing support for explicit source-code
annotations with additional features targeted at source profiling
for externally generated programs, including programs generated by
language front ends that target Scheme and use Chez Scheme as the
back end.
Included is a <tt>profile</tt> expression that explicitly associates
a specified source object with a profile count (of times the
expression is evaluated), <tt>generate-profile-forms</tt> parameter
that controls whether the compiler (also) associates profile counts
with source locations implicitly identified by annotated expressions
in the input, and a finer-grained method for marking whether an
individual annotation should be used for debugging, profiling, or
both.

<p>

<a name="g90"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h90"></a>2.89. "Maybe" file (re)compilation (9.3.1)</h4>




<p>
When <tt>compile-imported-libraries</tt> is set to <tt>#t</tt>,
libraries required indirectly by one of the
file-compilation procedures, e.g., <tt>compile-library</tt>,
<tt>compile-program</tt>, and <tt>compile-file</tt>, are automatically
compiled if and only if the object file is not present, older than
the source (main and include) files, or some library upon which
they depend has been or needs to be recompiled.

<p>
Version 9.3.1 adds three new procedures: <tt>maybe-recompile-library</tt>,
<tt>maybe-recompile-program</tt>, and <tt>maybe-recompile-file</tt>,
that perform a similar analysis and compile the library, program,
or file only under similar circumstances.

<p>

<a name="g91"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h91"></a>2.90. New primitives for querying memory utilization (9.3.1)</h4>




<p>
Three new primitives have been added to allow a Scheme process to
track usage of virtual memory for its heap.

<p>
<tt>current-memory-bytes</tt> returns the total number of bytes of
virtual memory used or reserved to represent the Scheme heap.
This differs from <tt>bytes-allocated</tt>, which returns the number
of bytes currently occupied by Scheme objects.
<tt>current-memory-bytes</tt> additionally includes memory used for
heap management as well as memory held in reserve to satisfy future
allocation requests.

<p>
<tt>maximum-memory-bytes</tt> returns the maximum number of bytes
of virtual memory occupied or reserved for the Scheme heap by the
calling process since the last call to <tt>reset-maximum-memory-bytes!</tt>
or, if <tt>reset-maximum-memory-bytes!</tt> has never been called,
since system start-up.

<p>
<tt>reset-maximum-memory-bytes!</tt> resets the maximum memory bytes
to the current memory bytes.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h92"></a>2.91. Unicode 7.0 support (9.3.1)</h4>




<p>
The character sets, character classes, and word-breaking algorithms
for character, string, and Unicode-related bytevector operations
have now been updated to Unicode 7.0.

<p>

<a name="g93"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h93"></a>2.92. Linux PowerPC (32-bit) support (9.3)</h4>




<p>
Support for running <i>Chez Scheme</i> on 32-bit PowerPC processors
running Linux has been added, with machines type ppc32le (nonthreaded)
and tppc32le (threaded).
C&nbsp;code intended to be linked with these versions of the system
should be compiled using the GNU C&nbsp;compiler's <tt>-m32</tt> option.

<p>

<a name="g94"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h94"></a>2.93. Printed representation of procedures (9.2.1)</h4>




<p>
The printed representation of a procedure now includes the source
file and beginning file position when available.

<p>

<a name="g95"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h95"></a>2.94. I/O errors writing to the console error port (9.2.1)</h4>




<p>
The default exception handler now catches I/O exceptions that occur
when it attempts to display a condition and, if an I/O exception
does occur, resets as if by calling the <tt>reset</tt> procedure.
The intent is to avoid an infinite regression (ultimately ending
in exhaustion of memory) in which the process repeatedly recurs
back to the default exception handler trying to write to a console-error
port (typically stderr) that is no longer writable, e.g., due to
the other end of a pipe or socket having been closed.

<p>

<a name="g96"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h96"></a>2.95. C locking macros (9.2.1)</h4>




<p>
The header file scheme.h distributed with Chez Scheme now includes
several new lock-related macros:
<tt>INITLOCK</tt> (corresponding to <tt>ftype-init-lock!</tt>),
<tt>SPINLOCK</tt> (<tt>ftype-spin-lock!</tt>),
<tt>UNLOCK</tt> (<tt>ftype-unlock!</tt>),
<tt>LOCKED_INCR</tt> (<tt>ftype-locked-incr!</tt>), and
<tt>LOCKED_DECR</tt> (<tt>ftype-locked-decr!</tt>).
All take a pointer to an iptr or uptr.
<tt>LOCKED_INCR</tt> and <tt>LOCKED_DECR</tt> also take an
<tt>lvalue</tt> argument that is set to true (nonzero) if the result
of the increment or decrement is zero, otherwise false (zero).

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h97"></a>2.96. New <tt>compile-to-file</tt> procedure (9.2.1)</h4>




<p>
The new procedure <tt>compile-to-file</tt> is similar to
<tt>compile-to-port</tt> with the output port replaced with an
output pathname.

<p>

<a name="g98"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h98"></a>2.97. Whole-program optimization (9.2)</h4>




<p>
Version 9.2 includes support for whole-program optimization of a top-level
program and the libraries upon which it depends at run time based on "wpo"
(whole-program-optimization) files produced as a byproduct of compiling
the program and libraries when the parameter <tt>generate-wpo-files</tt>
is set to <tt>#t</tt>.
The new procedure <tt>compile-whole-program</tt> takes as input
a wpo file for a top-level program, combines it with the wpo files for
any libraries the program requires at run time, and produces a single
object file containing a self-contained program.
In so doing, it discards unused code and optimizes across program and
library boundaries, potentially reducing program load time, run time,
and memory requirements.

<p>
<tt>compile-file</tt>, <tt>compile-program</tt>, <tt>compile-library</tt>,
and <tt>compile-script</tt> produce wpo files as well as ordinary
object files when the new <tt>generate-wpo-files</tt> parameter is set
to <tt>#t</tt> (the default is <tt>#f</tt>).
<tt>compile-port</tt> and <tt>compile-to-port</tt> do so when passed
an optional <tt><i>wpo output port</i></tt>.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h99"></a>2.98. Type-specific symbol-hashtable operators (9.2)<a name="sec:symbol-hashtables"></a></h4>




<p>
A new set of primitives that operate on symbol
hashtables has been added:

<p>

<p><tt>symbol-hashtable?<br>

symbol-hashtable-ref<br>

symbol-hashtable-set!<br>

symbol-hashtable-contains?<br>

symbol-hashtable-cell<br>

symbol-hashtable-update!<br>

symbol-hashtable-delete!</tt>
<p>These are like their generic counterparts but operate only on symbol
hashtables, i.e., hashtables created with <tt>symbol-hash</tt> as
the hash function and <tt>eq?</tt>, <tt>eqv?</tt>, <tt>equal?</tt>,
or <tt>symbol=?</tt> as the equivalence function.

<p>
These primitives are more efficient at optimize-level 3 than their
generic counterparts when both are applied to symbol hashtables.
The performance of symbol hashtables has been improved even when the new
operators are not used (Section&nbsp;<a href="./release_notes.html#g254">4.19</a>).

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h100"></a>2.99. <tt>strip-fasl-file</tt> is now machine-independent (9.2)</h4>




<p>
<tt>strip-fasl-file</tt> can now strip fasl files created for a machine
type other than the machine type of the calling process as long as the
Chez Scheme version is the same.

<p>

<a name="g101"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h101"></a>2.100. <tt>source-file-descriptor</tt> and <tt>locate-source</tt> (9.2)</h4>




<p>
The new procedure <tt>source-file-descriptor</tt> can be used to construct
a custom source-file descriptor or reconstruct a source-file descriptor
from values previously extracted from another source-file descriptor.
It takes two arguments: a string <tt><i>path</i></tt> and exact nonnegative integer
<tt><i>checksum</i></tt> and returns a new source-file descriptor.

<p>
The new procedure <tt>locate-source</tt> can be used to determine a full
path, line number, and character position from a source-file descriptor
and file position.
It accepts two arguments: a source-file descriptor <tt><i>sfd</i></tt> and an
exact nonnegative integer file position <tt><i>fp</i></tt>.
It returns zero values if the unmodified file is not found in the source
directories and three values (string <tt><i>path</i></tt>, exact nonnegative
integer <tt><i>line</i></tt>, and exact nonnegative integer <tt><i>char</i></tt>) if the
file is found.

<p>

<a name="g102"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h102"></a>2.101. Compressed compiled scripts and partially compressed files (9.2)</h4>




<p>
Support for creating and handling files that begin with uncompressed
data and end with compressed data has been added in the form of the
new procedure <tt>port-file-compressed!</tt> that takes a port and
if not already set up to read or write compressed data, sets it up
to do so.
The port must be a file port pointing to a regular file, i.e., a
file on disk rather than a socket or pipe, and the port must not be
an input/output port.
The port can be a binary or textual port.
If the port is an output port, subsequent output sent to the port
will be compressed.
If the port is an input port, subsequent input will be decompressed
if and only if the port is currently pointing at compressed data.

<p>
When the parameter <tt>compile-compressed</tt> is set ot <tt>#t</tt>,
the <tt>compile-script</tt> and <tt>compile-program</tt> procedures
take advantage of this functionality to copy the <tt>#!</tt> prefix,
if present in the source file, uncompressed in the object file while
compressing the object code emitted for the program, thus reducing
the size of the resulting file without preventing the <tt>#!</tt>
line from being read and interpreted properly by the operating
system.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h103"></a>2.102. Change in library import handling (9.2)</h4>




<p>
In previous releases, when an object file was found before the
corresponding source file in the library directories, the object file was
older, and the parameter <tt>compile-imported-libraries</tt> was not set,
the object file was loaded rather than the source file.
The (newer) source file is now loaded instead, just as it would be if
the source file is found before the corresponding, older object file.
This is an <i>incompatible change</i>.

<p>

<a name="g104"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h104"></a>2.103. Change in fasl-strip options (9.1)</h4>




<p>
<tt>strip-fasl-file</tt> now supports stripping of all compile-time
information and no longer supports stripping of just library visit code.
Stripping all compile-time information nearly always results in smaller
object files than stripping just library visit code, with a corresponding
reduction in the memory required when the resulting
file is loaded.

<p>
To reflect this, the old fasl-strip option <tt>library-visit-code</tt>
has been eliminated, and the new fasl-strip option
<tt>compile-time-information</tt> has been added.
This is an <i>incompatible change</i> in that code that previously
used the fasl-strip option <tt>library-visit-code</tt> will
have to be modified to omit the option or to replace it with
<tt>compile-time-information</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g105"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h105"></a>2.104. Library loading (9.1)</h4>




<p>
Visiting (via <tt>visit</tt>) a library no longer loads the library's
run-time information (invoke dependencies and invoke code), and revisiting
(via <tt>revisit</tt>) a library no longer loads the library's
compile-time information (import and visit dependencies and import and
visit code).

<p>
When a library is invoked due to a run-time dependency of another
library or a top-level program on the library, the library is now
"revisited" (as if via <tt>revisit</tt>) rather than "loaded"
(as if via <tt>load</tt>).
As a result, the compile-time information is not loaded, which can result
in substantial reductions in both library invocation time and memory
footprint.

<p>
If a library is revisited, either explicitly or as the result of run-time
dependency, a subsequent import of the library causes it to be
"visited" (as if via <tt>visit</tt>) if the same object file can be
found at the same path and the visit code has not been stripped.
The compile-time code can alternatively be loaded explicitly from the same or a
different file via a direct call to <tt>visit</tt>.

<p>
While this change is mostly transparent (ignoring the reduced invocation
time and memory footprint), it is an <i>incompatible change</i> in the
sense that the system potentially reads the file twice and can run
code that is marked using <tt>eval-when</tt> as both visit
and revisit code.

<p>

<a name="g106"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h106"></a>2.105. Finding objects in the heap (9.1)</h4>




<p>
Version 9.1 includes support for a new heap inspection tool that
allows a programmer to look for objects in the heap according to
arbitrary predicates.
The new procedure <tt>make-object-finder</tt> takes a predicate <tt><i>pred</i></tt> and two optional
arguments: a starting point <tt><i>x</i></tt> and a maximum generation <tt><i>g</i></tt>.
The starting point defaults to the value of the procedure <tt>oblist</tt>,
and the maximum generation defaults to the value of the parameter
<tt>collect-maximum-generation</tt>.
<tt>make-object-finder</tt> returns an object finder <tt><i>p</i></tt> that can be used to
search for objects satisfying <tt><i>pred</i></tt> within the starting-point object <tt><i>x</i></tt>.
Immediate objects and objects in generations older than <tt><i>g</i></tt> are treated
as leaves.
<tt><i>p</i></tt> is a procedure accepting no arguments.
If an object <tt><i>y</i></tt> satisfying <tt><i>pred</i></tt> can be found starting with <tt><i>x</i></tt>,
<tt><i>p</i></tt> returns a list whose first element is <tt><i>y</i></tt> and whose remaining
elements represent the path of objects from <tt><i>x</i></tt> to <tt><i>y</i></tt>, listed
in reverse order.
<tt><i>p</i></tt> can be invoked multiple times to find additional objects satisfying
the predicate, if any.
<tt><i>p</i></tt> returns <tt>#f</tt> if no more objects matching the predicate
can be found.

<p>
<tt><i>p</i></tt> maintains internal state recording where it has been so that it
can restart at the point of the last found object and not return
the same object twice.
The state can be several times the size of the starting-point object
<tt><i>x</i></tt> and all that is reachable from <tt><i>x</i></tt>.

<p>
The interactive inspector provides a convenient interface to the object
finder in the form of <tt>find</tt> and <tt>find-next</tt> commands.
The <tt>find</tt> command evaluates its first argument, which should
evaluate to the desired predicate, and treats its second argument, if
present, as the maximum generation, overriding the default.
The starting point <tt><i>x</i></tt> is the object upon which the
inspector is currently focused.
If an object is found, the inspector's new focus is the found object,
the parent focus (obtainable via the <tt>up</tt> command) is the first
element in the (reversed) path, the parent's parent is the next element,
and so on up to <tt><i>x</i></tt>.
The <tt>find-next</tt> command repeats the last find, as if by an explicit
invocation of the same object finder.

<p>
Relocation tables for static code objects are discarded by default, which
prevents object finders from providing accurate results when static code
objects are involved.
That is, they will not find any objects pointed to directly from a code
object that has been promoted to the static generation.
If this is a problem, the command-line argument
<tt>--retain-static-relocation</tt> can be used to prevent the relocation
tables from being discarded.

<p>

<a name="g107"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h107"></a>2.106. Object counts (9.1)</h4>




<p>
The new procedure <tt>object-counts</tt> can be used to determine,
for each type of object, the number and size in bytes of objects of
that type in each generation.
Its return value has the following structure:

<p>

<p><tt>((<i>type</i>&nbsp;(<i>generation</i>&nbsp;<i>count</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;<i>bytes</i>)&nbsp;...)&nbsp;...)</tt>
<p><tt><i>type</i></tt> is either the name of a primitive type, represented as a
symbol, e.g., <tt>pair</tt>, or a record-type descriptor (rtd).
<tt><i>generation</i></tt> is a nonnegative fixnum between 0 and the value
of <tt>(collect-maximum-generation)</tt>, inclusive, or the symbol
<tt>static</tt> representing the static generation.
<tt><i>count</i></tt> and <tt><i>bytes</i></tt> are nonnegative fixnums.

<p>
Object counts are accurate for a generation <i>n</i> immediately after
a collection of generation <i>n</i> or higher if enabled during that
collection.
Object counts are enabled by setting the parameter
<tt>enable-object-counts</tt> to <tt>#t</tt>.
The command-line option <tt>--enable-object-counts</tt> can be used to
set this parameter to <tt>#t</tt> on startup.
Object counts are not enabled by default since it adds overhead to
garbage collection.

<p>
To make the information more useful in the presence of ftype pointers,
the ftype descriptors produced by <tt>define-ftype</tt> for each
defined ftype now carry the name of the ftype rather than a generic
name like <tt>ftd-struct</tt>.
(Ftype descriptors are subtypes of record-type descriptors and can appear
as types in the <tt>object-counts</tt> return value.)

<p>

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h108"></a>2.107. Native-eol style is now none (9.1)</h4>




<p>
To simplify interaction with tools that naively expose multiple-character
end-of-line sequences such as CRLF as separate characters to the user, the
native end-of-line style (<tt>native-eol-style</tt>) is now <tt>none</tt>
on all machine types.
This is an <i>incompatible change</i>.

<p>

<a name="g109"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h109"></a>2.108. Library-requirements options (9.1)</h4>




<p>
In previous releases, the <tt>library-requirements</tt> procedure
returns a list of all libraries required by the specified library,
whether they are needed when the specified library is imported,
visited, or invoked.
While this remains the default behavior, <tt>library-requirements</tt>
now takes an optional "options" argument.
This must be a library-requirements-options enumerations set, i.e., the
value of a <tt>library-requirements-options</tt> form with some subset of
the options <tt>import</tt>, <tt>visit@visit</tt>, <tt>invoke@visit</tt>,
and <tt>invoke</tt>.  <tt>import</tt> includes the libraries
that must be imported when the specified library is imported;
<tt>visit@visit</tt> includes the libraries that must be visited when
the specified library is visited; <tt>invoke@visit</tt> includes the libraries
that must be invoked when the specified library is visited; and
<tt>invoke</tt> includes the libraries that must be invoked when
the specified library is invoked.
The default behavior is obtained by supplying a enumeration set containing all
of these options.

<p>

<a name="g110"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h110"></a>2.109. Nested object size and composition (9.1)</h4>




<p>
Two new procedures, <tt>compute-size</tt> and
<tt>compute-composition</tt>, can be used to determine the
size and make-up of nested objects with the heap.

<p>
Both take an object and an optional generation.
The generation must be a fixnum between 0 and the value of
<tt>(collect-maximum-generation)</tt>, inclusive, or the symbol static.
It defaults to the value of <tt>(collect-maximum-generation)</tt>.

<p>
<tt>compute-size</tt> returns the number of bytes occupied by the object
and everything to which it points, ignoring objects in generations older
than the specified generation.

<p>
<tt>compute-composition</tt> returns an association list giving the
number and number of bytes of each type of object that the specified
object is constructed from, ignoring objects in generations older than
the specified generation.  The association list maps type names (e.g.,
pair and flonum) or record-type descriptors to a pair of fixnums
giving the count and bytes.
Types with zero counts are not included in the list.

<p>
A surprising number of objects effectively point indirectly to a large
percentage of all objects in the heap due to the attachment of top-level
environment bindings to symbols, but the generation argument can be used
in combination with explicit calls to collect (with automatic collections
disabled) to measure precisely how much space is allocated to freshly
allocated structures.

<p>
When used directly from the REPL with no other threads running,
<tt>(compute-size&nbsp;(oblist)&nbsp;'static)</tt> effectively gives the size of
the entire heap, and <tt>(compute-composition&nbsp;(oblist)&nbsp;'static)</tt>
effectively gives the composition of the entire heap.

<p>
The inspector makes the aggregate size of an object similarly available
through the <tt>size</tt> inspector-object message and the corresponding
<tt>size</tt> interactive-inspector command, with the twist that it
does not include objects whose sizes were previously requested in the
same session, making it possible to see the effectively smaller sizes
of what the programmer perceives to be substructures in shared and
cyclic structures.

<p>
These procedures potentially allocate a large amount of memory and
so should be used only when the information returned by the
procedure <tt>object-counts</tt> (see preceding entry) does not suffice.

<p>
Relocation tables for static code objects are discarded by default,
which prevents these procedures from providing accurate results when
static code objects are involved.
That is, they will not find any objects pointed to directly from a code
object that has been promoted to the static generation.
If accurate sizes and compositions for static code objects are
required, the command-line argument <tt>--retain-static-relocation</tt>
can be used to prevent the relocation tables from being discarded.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h111"></a>2.110. Showing expander and optimizer output (9.1)</h4>




<p>
When the parameter <tt>expand-output</tt> is set to a textual output
port, the output of the expander is printed to the port as a side effect
of running <tt>compile</tt>, <tt>interpret</tt>, or any of the file
compiling primitives, e.g., <tt>compile-file</tt> or
<tt>compile-library</tt>.
Similarly, when the parameter <tt>expand/optimize-output</tt> is set to a
textual output port, the output of the source optimizer is printed.

<p>

<a name="g112"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h112"></a>2.111. Undefined-variable warnings (9.1)</h4>




<p>
When <tt>undefined-variable-warnings</tt> is set to <tt>#t</tt>, the
compiler issues a warning message whenever it cannot determine that
a variable bound by <tt>letrec</tt>, <tt>letrec*</tt>, or an internal
definition will not be referenced before it is defined.
The default value is <tt>#f</tt>.

<p>
Regardless of the setting of this parameter, the compiler inserts code
to check for the error, except at optimize level 3.
The check is fairly inexpensive and does not typically inhibit inlining
or other optimizations.
In code that must be carefully tuned, however, it is sometimes useful
to reorder bindings or make other changes to eliminate the checks.
Enabling this warning can facilitate this process.

<p>
The checks are also visible in the output of <tt>expand/optimize</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g113"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h113"></a>2.112. Detecting accidental use of generative record types (9.1)</h4>




<p>
When the new boolean parameter <tt>require-nongenerative-clause</tt>
is set to <tt>#t</tt>, a <tt>define-record-type</tt> without a
<tt>nongenerative</tt> clause is treated as a syntax error.
This allows the programmer to detect accidental use of generative
record types.
Generative record types are rarely useful and are less efficient
than nongenerative types, since generative record types require the
construction of a record-type-descriptor each time a
<tt>define-record-type</tt> form is evaluated rather than once,
at compile time.
To support the rare need for a generative record type while still
allowing accidental generativity to be detected,
<tt>define-record-type</tt> has been extended to allow a generative
record type to be explicitly declared with a <tt>nongenerative</tt>
clause with <tt>#f</tt> for the uid, i.e., <tt>(nongenerative&nbsp;#f)</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g114"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h114"></a>2.113. Improved support for cross compilation (9.1)</h4>




<p>
Cross-compilation support has been improved in two ways: (1) it is
now possible to cross-compile a library and import it later in a
separate process for cross-compilation of dependent libraries, and
(2) the code produced for the target machine when cross compiling is no
longer less efficient than code produced natively on the target
machine.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h115"></a>2.114. Linux ARMv6 (32-bit) support (9.1)</h4>




<p>
Support for running <i>Chez Scheme</i> on ARMv6 processors running Linux
has been added, with machine type arm32le (32-bit nonthreaded).
C&nbsp;code intended to be linked with these versions of the system
should be compiled using the GNU C&nbsp;compiler's <tt>-m32</tt> option.

<p>

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h116"></a>2.115. Source information in ftype ref/set! error messages (9.0)</h4>




<p>
When available at compile time, source information is now included
in run-time error messages produced when <tt>ftype-&amp;ref</tt>,
<tt>ftype-ref</tt>, <tt>ftype-set!</tt>, and the locked ftype
operations are handed invalid inputs, e.g., ftype pointers of some
unexpected type, RHS values of some unexpected type, or improper
indices.

<p>

<a name="g117"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h117"></a>2.116. <tt>compile-to-port</tt> top-level-program dependencies (9.0)</h4>




<p>
When passed a single <tt>top-level-program</tt> form,
<tt>compile-to-port</tt> now returns a list of the libraries the
top-level program requires at run time, as with <tt>compile-program</tt>.
Otherwise, the return value is unspecified.

<p>

<a name="g118"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h118"></a>2.117. Better feedback for record-type mismatches (9.0)</h4>




<p>
When <tt>make-record-type</tt> or <tt>make-record-type-descriptor</tt>
detect an incompatibility between two record types with the same
UID, the resulting error messages provide more information to
describe the mismatch, i.e., whether the parent, fields, flags, or
mutability differ.

<p>

<a name="g119"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h119"></a>2.118. <tt>enable-cross-library-optimization</tt> parameter (9.0)</h4>




<p>
When a library is compiled, information is stored with the object
code to enable propagation of constants and inlining of procedures
defined in the library into dependent libraries.
The new parameter <tt>enable-cross-library-optimization</tt>, whose
value defaults to <tt>#t</tt>, can be set to <tt>#f</tt> to prevent
this information from being stored and disable the corresponding
optimizations.
This might be done to reduce the size of the object files or to
reduce the potential for exposure of near-source information via
the object file.

<p>

<a name="g120"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h120"></a>2.119. Stripping object files (9.0)</h4>




<p>
The new procedure <tt>strip-fasl-file</tt> allows the removal of
source information of various sorts from a compiled object (fasl) file
produced by <tt>compile-file</tt> or one of the other file compiling
procedures.
It also allows removal of library visit code, i.e., the code
required to compile (but not run) dependent libraries.

<p>
<tt>strip-fasl-file</tt> accepts three arguments: an input pathname,
and output pathname, and a fasl-strip-options enumeration set,
created by <tt>fasl-strip-options</tt> with zero or more of the
following options.

<p>
<dl compact>
<dt><tt>inspector-source</tt>:<dd>
Strip inspector source information.

<p>
<dt><tt>source-annotations</tt>:<dd>
Strip source annotations.

<p>
<dt><tt>profile-source</tt>:<dd>
Strip source file and character position information from profiled
code objects.

<p>
<dt><tt>library-visit-code</tt>:<dd>
This strips library visit code from compiled libraries.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h121"></a>2.120. Ftype array bound of zero (9.0)</h4>




<p>
The bound of an ftype array can now be zero and, when zero, is
treated as unbounded in the sense that no run-time upper-bound
checks are performed for accesses to the array.
This simplifies the creation of ftype arrays whose actual bounds
are determined dynamically.

<p>

<a name="g122"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h122"></a>2.121. <tt>compile-profile</tt> no longer implies <tt>generate-inspector-information</tt> (9.0)</h4>




<p>
In previous releases, profile and inspector source information was
gathered and stored together so that compiling with profiling enabled
required that inspector information also be stored with each code object.
This is no longer the case.

<p>

<a name="g123"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h123"></a>2.122. <tt>case</tt> now uses <tt>member</tt> (9.0)</h4>




<p>
<tt>case</tt> now uses <tt>member</tt> rather than <tt>memv</tt> for key
comparisons, a generalization that allows <tt>case</tt> to be used for
strings, lists, vectors, etc., rather than just atomic values.
This adds no overhead when keys are comparable with <tt>memv</tt>,
since the compiler converts calls to <tt>member</tt> into calls to
<tt>memv</tt> (or <tt>memq</tt>, or even individual inline pointer
comparisons) when it can determine the more expensive test is not
required.

<p>
The <tt>case</tt> syntax exported by the <tt>(rnrs)</tt> and
<tt>(rnrs&nbsp;base)</tt> libraries still uses <tt>memv</tt> for
compatibility with the R6RS standard.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h124"></a>2.123. <tt>write</tt> and <tt>display</tt> and foreign addresses (9.0)</h4>




<p>
The <tt>write</tt> and <tt>display</tt> procedures now recognize
foreign addresses that happen to look like Scheme objects and print
them as <tt>#&lt;foreign&gt;</tt>; previously, <tt>write</tt> and
<tt>display</tt> would attempt to treat the addresses as Scheme
objects, typically leading to invalid memory references.
Some foreign addresses are indistinguishable from fixnums and
still print as fixnums.

<p>

<a name="g125"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h125"></a>2.124. Profile-directed optimization (9.0)</h4>




<p>
Compiled code can be instrumented to gather two kinds of
execution counts, source-level and block-level, via different settings
of the <tt>compile-profile</tt> parameter.
When <tt>compile-profile</tt> is set to the symbol <tt>source</tt>
at compile time, source execution counts are gathered by the generated
code, and when <tt>compile-profile</tt> is set to <tt>block</tt>,
block execution counts are gathered.
Setting it to <tt>#f</tt> (the default) disables instrumentation.

<p>
Source counts are identical to the source counts gathered by generated
code in previous releases when compiled with
<tt>compile-profile</tt> set to <tt>#t</tt>, and <tt>#t</tt>
can be still be used in place of <tt>source</tt> for backward
compatibility.
Source counts can be viewed by the programmer at the end of the run
of the generated code via <tt>profile-dump-list</tt> and
<tt>profile-dump-html</tt>.

<p>
Block counts are per <i>basic block</i>.
Basic blocks are individual sequences of straight-line code and are
the building blocks of the machine code generated by the compiler.
Counting the number of times a block is executed is thus equivalent
to counting the number of times the instructions within it are
executed.

<p>
There is no mechanism for the programmer to view block counts, but
both block counts and source counts can now be saved after a sample
run of the generated code for use in guiding various optimizations
during a subsequent compilation of the same code.

<p>
The source counts can be used by "profile-aware macros," i.e.,
macros whose expansion is guided by profiling information.
A profile-aware macro can use profile information to optimize
the code it produces.
For example, a macro defining an abstract datatype might choose
representations and algorithms based on the frequencies
of its operations.
Similarly, a macro, like <tt>case</tt>, that performs a set of
disjoint tests might choose to order those tests based on which are
most likely to succeed.
Indeed, the built-in <tt>case</tt> now does just that.
A new syntactic form, <tt>exclusive-cond</tt>, abstracts a common
use case for profile-aware macros.

<p>
The block counts are used to guide certain low-level optimizations,
such as block ordering and register allocation.

<p>
The procedure <tt>profile-dump-data</tt> writes to a specified file
the profile data collected during the run of a program compiled
with <tt>compile-profile</tt> set to either <tt>source</tt> or
<tt>block</tt>.
It is similar to <tt>profile-dump-list</tt> or <tt>profile-dump-html</tt>
but stores the profile data in a machine readable form.

<p>
The procedure <tt>profile-load-data</tt> loads one or more files
previously created by <tt>profile-dump-data</tt> into an internal
database.

<p>
The database associates <i>weights</i> with source locations or
blocks, where a weight is a flonum representing the ratio of the
location's count versus the maximum count.
When multiple profile data sets are loaded, the weights for each
location are averaged across the data sets.

<p>
The procedure <tt>profile-query-weight</tt> accepts a source object
and returns the weight associated with the location identified by
the source object, or <tt>#f</tt> if no weight is associated with
the location.
This procedure is intended to be used by a profile-aware macro on
pieces of its input to optimize code based on profile data previously
stored by <tt>profile-dump-data</tt> and loaded by
<tt>profile-load-data</tt>.

<p>
The procedure <tt>profile-clear-data</tt> clears the database.

<p>
The new <tt>exclusive-cond</tt> syntax is similar to <tt>cond</tt>
except it assumes the tests performed by the clauses are disjoint
and reorders them based on available profiling data.
Because the tests might be reordered, the order in which side effects
of the test expressions occur is undefined.
The built-in <tt>case</tt> form is implemented in terms of
<tt>exclusive-cond</tt>.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h126"></a>2.125. New <tt>ssize_t</tt> foreign type (9.0)</h4>

A new foreign type, <tt>ssize_t</tt>, is now supported.
It is the signed analogue of <tt>size_t</tt>.

argument, the representative is returned from the guardian in place
of the guarded object when the guarded object is no longer accessible.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h128"></a>2.127. Library reloading on dependency change (9.0)</h4>

A library initially imported from an object file is now reimported from

since the library was compiled.

<p>

<a name="g129"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h129"></a>2.128. Expression-editor filename completion (8.9.5)</h4>




<p>
The expression editor now performs filename- rather than
command-completion within string constants.
It looks only at the current line to determine whether the cursor is
within a string constant; this can lead to the wrong kind of command
completion for strings that cross line boundaries.

<p>

<a name="g130"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h130"></a>2.129. New lock mechanisms and elimination of old lock mechanism (8.9.5)</h4>




<p>
The built in ftype <tt>ftype-lock</tt> has been eliminated along
with the corresponding procedures, <tt>acquire-lock</tt>,
<tt>release-lock</tt>, and <tt>initialize-lock</tt>.
This is an incompatible change, although defining
<tt>ftype-lock</tt> and the associated procedures is straightforward
using the forms described below.

<p>
The functionality has been replaced and generalized by four new syntactic
forms that operate on lock fields wherever they appear within a foreign
type:

<p>

<p><tt>(ftype-init-lock!&nbsp;<i>T</i>&nbsp;(<i>a</i>&nbsp;...)&nbsp;<i>e</i>)<br>

(ftype-lock!&nbsp;<i>T</i>&nbsp;(<i>a</i>&nbsp;...)&nbsp;<i>e</i>)<br>

(ftype-spin-lock!&nbsp;<i>T</i>&nbsp;(<i>a</i>&nbsp;...)&nbsp;<i>e</i>)<br>

(ftype-unlock!&nbsp;<i>T</i>&nbsp;(<i>a</i>&nbsp;...)&nbsp;<i>e</i>)</tt>
<p>The access chain <tt><i>a</i>&nbsp;...</tt> must specify a word-size
integer represented using the native endianness, i.e., a <tt>uptr</tt>
or <tt>iptr</tt>.
It is a syntax violation when this is not the case.

<p>
For each of the forms, the expression <tt><i>e</i></tt> is evaluated first
and must evaluate to a ftype pointer <tt><i>p</i></tt> of type <tt><i>T</i></tt>.

<p>
<tt>ftype-init-lock!</tt> initializes the specified field of the foreign
object to which <tt><i>p</i></tt> points, puts the field into the unlocked state,
and returns an unspecified value.

<p>
If the field is in the unlocked state, <tt>ftype-lock!</tt> puts it
into the locked state and returns <tt>#t</tt>.
If the field is already in the locked state, <tt>ftype-lock!</tt>
returns <tt>#f</tt>.

<p>
<tt>ftype-spin-lock!</tt> loops until the lock is in the unlocked
state, then puts it into the locked state and returns an unspecified
value.
<i>This operation will never return if no other thread or process
unlocks the field, causing interrupts and requests for collection to
be ignored.</i>

<p>
Finally, <tt>ftype-unlock</tt> puts the field into the unlocked state
(regardless of the current state) and returns an unspecified value.

<p>
An additional pair of syntactic forms can be used when just an
atomic increment or decrement is required:

<p>

<p><tt>(ftype-locked-incr!&nbsp;<i>T</i>&nbsp;(<i>a</i>&nbsp;...)&nbsp;<i>e</i>)<br>

(ftype-locked-decr!&nbsp;<i>T</i>&nbsp;(<i>a</i>&nbsp;...)&nbsp;<i>e</i>)</tt>
<p>As for the first set of forms, the access chain <tt><i>a</i>&nbsp;...</tt>
must specify a word-size integer represented using the native endianness.

<p>

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h131"></a>2.130. <tt>ftype-pointer-null?</tt>, <tt>ftype-pointer=?</tt> (8.9.5)</h4>




<p>
The new procedure <tt>ftype-pointer-null?</tt> can be used to compare the
address of its single argument, which must be an ftype pointer, against 0.
It returns <tt>#t</tt> if the address is 0 and <tt>#f</tt> otherwise.
Similarly, <tt>ftype-pointer=?</tt> can be used to compare the
addresses of two ftype-pointer arguments.
It returns <tt>#t</tt> if the address are the same and <tt>#f</tt>
otherwise.

<p>
These are potentially more efficient than extracting ftype-pointer
addresses first, which might result in bignum allocation for addresses
outside the fixnum range,
although the compiler also now
tries to avoid allocation when the result of a call to
<tt>ftype-pointer-address</tt> is directly compared with 0 or with the
result of another call to <tt>ftype-pointer-address</tt>, as described
in Section&nbsp;<a href="./release_notes.html#g261">4.26</a>.

<a name="g132"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h132"></a>2.131. <tt>gensym</tt>'s new optional unique-name argument (8.9.5)</h4>




<p>
<tt>gensym</tt> now accepts a second optional argument, the unique
name to use.
It must be a string and should not be used by any other gensym intended
to be distinct from the new gensym.

<p>

<a name="g133"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h133"></a>2.132. GC times now maintained with finer granularity (8.9.5)</h4>




<p>
In previous releases, collection times as reported by <tt>statistics</tt>
or printed by <tt>display-statistics</tt> were gathered internally
with millisecond granularity at each collection, possibly leading to
significant inaccuracies over the course of many collections.
They are now maintained using high-resolution timers with generally
much better accuracy.

<p>

<a name="g134"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h134"></a>2.133. New time types for tracking collection times (8.9.5)</h4>




<p>
New time types <tt>time-collector-cpu</tt> and <tt>time-collector-real</tt>
have been added.
When <tt>current-time</tt> is passed one of these types, a time
object of the specified type is returned and represents the time
(cpu or real) spent during collection.

<p>
Previously, this information was available only via the
<tt>statistics</tt> or <tt>display-statistics</tt> procedures, and then
with lower precision.

<p>

<a name="g135"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h135"></a>2.134. New storage-management introspection procedures (8.9.5)</h4>




<p>
Three new storage-management introspection procedures have been
added:

<p>

<p><tt>(collections)<br>

(initial-bytes-allocated)<br>

(bytes-deallocated)</tt>
<p><tt>collections</tt> returns the number of collections performed so
far by the current Scheme process.

<p>
<tt>initial-bytes-allocated</tt> returns the number of bytes
allocated after loading the boot files and before running any
non-boot user code.

<p>
<tt>bytes-deallocated</tt> returns the total number of bytes
deallocated by the collector.

<p>
Previously, this information was available only via the
<tt>statistics</tt> or <tt>display-statistics</tt>
procedures.

<p>

<a name="g136"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h136"></a>2.135. New time-object manipulation procedures (8.9.5)</h4>




<p>
Three new procedures for performing arithmetic on time objects have
been added, per SRFI&nbsp;19:

<p>

<p><tt>(time-difference&nbsp;<i>t1</i>&nbsp;<i>t2</i>)&nbsp;<img src="math/release_notes/0.gif" alt="<graphic>">&nbsp;<i>t3</i><br>

(add-duration&nbsp;<i>t1</i>&nbsp;<i>t2</i>)&nbsp;<img src="math/release_notes/0.gif" alt="<graphic>">&nbsp;<i>t3</i><br>

(subtract-duration&nbsp;<i>t1</i>&nbsp;<i>t2</i>)&nbsp;<img src="math/release_notes/0.gif" alt="<graphic>">&nbsp;<i>t3</i></tt>
<p><tt>time-difference</tt> takes two time objects <tt><i>t1</i></tt> and <tt><i>t2</i></tt>,
which must have the same time type, and returns the result of subtracting
<tt><i>t2</i></tt> from <tt><i>t1</i></tt>, represented as a new time object with type
<tt>time-duration</tt>.
<tt>add-duration</tt> adds time object <tt><i>t2</i></tt>, which must be of type
<tt>time-duration</tt>, to time object <tt><i>t1</i></tt>, producing a new time object
<tt><i>t3</i></tt> with the same type as <tt><i>t1</i></tt>.
<tt>subtract-duration</tt> subtracts time object <tt><i>t2</i></tt> which must be
of type <tt>time-duration</tt>, from time object <tt><i>t1</i></tt>, producing a new
time object <tt><i>t3</i></tt> with the same type as <tt><i>t1</i></tt>.

<p>
SRFI&nbsp;19 also names destructive versions of these operators:

<p>

<p><tt>(time-difference!&nbsp;<i>t1</i>&nbsp;<i>t2</i>)&nbsp;<img src="math/release_notes/0.gif" alt="<graphic>">&nbsp;<i>t3</i><br>

(add-duration!&nbsp;<i>t1</i>&nbsp;<i>t2</i>)&nbsp;<img src="math/release_notes/0.gif" alt="<graphic>">&nbsp;<i>t3</i><br>

(subtract-duration!&nbsp;<i>t1</i>&nbsp;<i>t2</i>)&nbsp;<img src="math/release_notes/0.gif" alt="<graphic>">&nbsp;<i>t3</i></tt>
<p>These are available as well in <i>Chez Scheme</i> but are actually
nondestructive, i.e., entirely equivalent to the nondestructive
versions.

<p>

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h137"></a>2.136. Better reporting of profile counts (8.9.4, 8.9.5)</h4>




<p>
The compiler now collects and reports profile counts for every
source expression that is not determined to be dead either at
compile time or by the time the profile information is obtained via
<tt>profile-dump-list</tt> or <tt>profile-dump-html</tt>.
Previously, the compiler suppressed profile counts for constants and
variable references in contexts where the information was likely (though
not guaranteed) to be redundant, and it dropped profile counts for some
forms that were optimized away, such as inlined calls, folded calls,
or useless code.
Furthermore, profile counts now uniformly represent the number of times
a source expression's evaluation was started, which was not always the
case before.

<p>
A small related enhancement has been made in the HTML output produced
by <tt>profile-dump-html</tt>.
Hovering over a source expression now shows, in addition to the count,
the starting position (line number and character) of the source expression
to which the count belongs.
This is useful for identifying when a source expression does not have its
own count but instead inherits the count (and color) from an enclosing
expression.

<p>

<a name="g138"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h138"></a>2.137. Virtual registers (8.9.4)</h4>




<p>
A limited set of <i>virtual registers</i> is now supported by the compiler
for use by programs that require high-speed, global, and mutable storage
locations.
Referencing or assigning a virtual register is potentially faster and
never slower than accessing an assignable local or global variable,
and the code sequences for doing so are generally smaller.
Assignment is potentially significantly faster because there is no need
to track pointers from the virtual registers to young objects, as there
is for variable locations that might reside in older generations.
On threaded versions of the system, virtual registers are "per thread"
and thus serve as thread-local storage in a manner that is less expensive
than thread parameters.

<p>
The interface consists of three procedures:

<p>
<tt>(virtual-register-count)</tt> returns the number of virtual registers.
As of this writing, the count is set at 16.  This number is fixed, i.e.,
cannot be changed except by recompiling <i>Chez Scheme</i> from source.

<p>
<tt>(set-virtual-register!&nbsp;<i>k</i>&nbsp;<i>x</i>)</tt> stores <tt><i>x</i></tt> in virtual
register <tt><i>k</i></tt>.
<tt><i>k</i></tt> must be a fixnum between 0 (inclusive) and the value of
<tt>(virtual-register-count)</tt> (exclusive).

<p>
<tt>(virtual-register&nbsp;<i>k</i>)</tt> returns the value most recently
stored in virtual register <tt><i>k</i></tt> (on the current thread, in threaded
versions of the system).

<p>
To get the fastest possible speed out of the latter two procedures,
<tt><i>k</i></tt> should be a constant embedded right in the call
(or propagatable via optimization to the call).
To avoid putting these constants in the source code, programmers should
consider using identifier macros to give names to virtual registers, e.g.:

<p>

<p><tt>(define-syntax&nbsp;foo<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;(identifier-syntax<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[id&nbsp;(virtual-register&nbsp;0)]<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[(set!&nbsp;id&nbsp;e)&nbsp;(set-virtual-register!&nbsp;0&nbsp;e)]))<br>

(set!&nbsp;foo&nbsp;'hello)<br>

foo&nbsp;<img src="math/release_notes/0.gif" alt="<graphic>">&nbsp;hello</tt>
<p>Virtual-registers must be treated as an application-level resource, i.e.,
libraries intended to be used by multiple applications should generally
not use virtual registers to avoid conflicts with the applications use of
the registers.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h139"></a>2.138. 24-, 40-, 48-, and 56-bit integer values (8.9.3)</h4>




<p>
Support for storing and extracting 24-, 40-, 48-, and 56-bit integers
to and from records, bytevectors, and foreign types (ftypes) has been
added.
For records and ftypes, this is accomplished by declaring a field
to be of type
<tt>integer-24</tt>, <tt>unsigned-24</tt>,
<tt>integer-40</tt>, <tt>unsigned-40</tt>,
<tt>integer-48</tt>, <tt>unsigned-48</tt>,
<tt>integer-56</tt>, or <tt>unsigned-56</tt>.
For bytevectors, this is accomplished via the following new
primitives:

<p>

<p><tt>bytevector-24-ref<br>

bytevector-24-set!<br>

bytevector-40-ref<br>

bytevector-40-set!<br>

bytevector-48-ref<br>

bytevector-48-set!<br>

bytevector-56-ref<br>

bytevector-56-set!</tt>
<p>Similarly, support has been added for sending and receiving
24-, 40-, 48-, and 56-bit integers to and from foreign code via
<tt>foreign-procedure</tt> and <tt>foreign-callable</tt>.
Arguments and return values of type <tt>integer-24</tt> and
<tt>unsigned-24</tt> are passed as 32-bit quantities, while
those of type <tt>integer-40</tt>, <tt>unsigned-40</tt>,
<tt>integer-48</tt>, <tt>unsigned-48</tt>, <tt>integer-56</tt>,
and <tt>unsigned-56</tt> are passed as 64-bit quantities.

<p>
For unpacked ftypes, a 48-bit (6-byte) quantity is aligned
on an even two-byte boundary, while a
24-bit (3-byte), 40-bit (5-byte), or 56-bit (7-byte) quantity
is aligned on an arbitrary byte boundary.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h140"></a>2.139. New <tt>pariah</tt> expression (8.9.3)</h4>




<p>
A <tt>pariah</tt> expression:

<p>

<p><tt>(pariah&nbsp;<i>expr</i>&nbsp;<i>expr</i>&nbsp;...)</tt>
<p>is syntactically similar and semantically equivalent to a begin
expression but tells the compiler that the expressions within are
relatively unlikely to be executed.
This information is currently used by the compiler for prioritizing
allocation of registers to variables and for putting pariah code
out-of-line in an attempt to reduce instruction cache misses for the
remaining code.

<p>
A <tt>pariah</tt> form is generally most usefully wrapped around the
consequent or alternative of an <tt>if</tt> expression to identify which
is the less likely path.

<p>
The compiler implicitly treats as pariah code any code that leads
up to an unconditional call to <tt>raise</tt>, <tt>error</tt>,
<tt>errorf</tt>, <tt>assertion-violation</tt>, etc., so it is not
necessary to wrap a <tt>pariah</tt> around such a call.

<p>
At some point, there will likely be an option for gathering similar
information automatically via profiling.
In the meantime, we are interested in feedback about whether the
mechanism is beneficial and whether the benefit of using the
<tt>pariah</tt> form outweighs the programming overhead.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h141"></a>2.140. Improved automatic library recompilation (8.9.2)</h4>




<p>
Local imports within a library now trigger automatic recompilation
of the library when the imported library has been recompiled or needs
to be recompiled, in the same manner as imports listed directly in the
importing library's <tt>library</tt> form.
Changes in include files also trigger automatic recompilation.

<p>
(Automatic recompilation of a library is enabled when an import of
the library, e.g., in another library or in a top-level program, is
compiled and the parameter <tt>compile-imported-libraries</tt> is set
to a true value.)

<p>

<a name="g142"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h142"></a>2.141. Redundant profile information (8.9.2)</h4>




<p>
Profiling information is no longer produced for constants and variable
references where the information is likely to be redundant.
It is still produced in contexts where the counts are likely to differ
from those of the enclosing form, e.g., where a constant or variable
reference occurs in the consequent or alternative of an <tt>if</tt>
expression.
This change brings the profiling information largely in sync with
Version&nbsp;8.4.1 and earlier, though Version&nbsp;8.9.2 retains source information
in a few cases where it is inappropriately discarded by Version&nbsp;8.4.1's
compiler, and Version&nbsp;8.9.2 discards source information in a few cases
where the code has been optimized away.

<p>

<a name="g143"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h143"></a>2.142. New <tt>compile-to-port</tt> procedure (8.9.2)</h4>




<p>
The procedure <tt>compile-to-port</tt> is like <tt>compile-port</tt>
but, instead of taking an input port from which it reads expressions
to be compiled, takes a list of expressions to be compiled.
As with <tt>compile-port</tt>, the second argument must be a binary
output port.

<p>

<a name="g144"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h144"></a>2.143. Debug levels (8.9.1)</h4>




<p>
Newly introduced debug levels control the amount of debugging support
embedded in the code generated by the compiler.
The current debug level is controlled by the parameter
<tt>debug-level</tt> and must be set when the compiler is run to have
any effect on the generated code.
Valid debug levels are&nbsp;0, 1, 2, and&nbsp;3, and the default is&nbsp;1.
At present, the only difference between debug levels is whether calls to
certain error-producing routines, like <tt>error</tt>, whether explicit
or as the result of an implicit run-time check (such as the pair check
in <tt>car</tt>), are treated as tail calls even when not in tail position.
At debug levels 0 and 1, they are treated as tail calls, and at debug
levels 2 and 3, they are treated as nontail calls.
Treating them as tail calls is more efficient, but treating them as
nontail calls leaves more information on the stack, which affects what
can be shown by the inspector.

<p>
For example, assume <tt>f</tt> is defined as follows:

<p>

<p><tt>(define&nbsp;f<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;(lambda&nbsp;(x)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(unless&nbsp;(pair?&nbsp;x)&nbsp;(error&nbsp;#f&nbsp;"oops"))<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(car&nbsp;x)))</tt>
<p>and is called with a non-pair argument, e.g.:

<p>

<p><tt>(f&nbsp;3)</tt>
<p>If the debug level is 2 or more at the time the definition is compiled,
the call to <tt>f</tt> will still be on the stack when the exception
is raised by <tt>error</tt> and will thus be visible to the inspector:

<p>

<p><tt>&gt;&nbsp;(f&nbsp;3)<br>

Exception:&nbsp;oops<br>

Type&nbsp;(debug)&nbsp;to&nbsp;enter&nbsp;the&nbsp;debugger.<br>

&gt;&nbsp;(debug)<br>

debug&gt;&nbsp;i<br>

#&lt;continuation&nbsp;in&nbsp;f&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;sf<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;0:&nbsp;#&lt;continuation&nbsp;in&nbsp;f&gt;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;1:&nbsp;#&lt;system&nbsp;continuation&nbsp;in&nbsp;new-cafe&gt;<br>

#&lt;continuation&nbsp;in&nbsp;f&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;s<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;continuation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#&lt;system&nbsp;continuation&nbsp;in&nbsp;new-cafe&gt;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;procedure&nbsp;code:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(lambda&nbsp;(x)&nbsp;(if&nbsp;(...)&nbsp;...)&nbsp;(car&nbsp;x))<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;call&nbsp;code:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(error&nbsp;#f&nbsp;"oops")<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;0.&nbsp;x:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</tt>
<p>On the other hand, if the debug level is 1 (the default) or 0 at the
time the definition of <tt>f</tt> is compiled, the call to <tt>f</tt>
will no longer be on the stack:

<p>

<p><tt>&gt;&nbsp;(f&nbsp;3)<br>

Exception:&nbsp;oops<br>

Type&nbsp;(debug)&nbsp;to&nbsp;enter&nbsp;the&nbsp;debugger.<br>

&gt;&nbsp;(debug)<br>

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h145"></a>2.144. Cost centers (8.9.1)</h4>




<p>
Cost centers are used to track the bytes allocated, instructions executed,
and/or cpu time elapsed while evaluating selected sections of code.
Cost centers are created via the procedure <tt>make-cost-center</tt>, and
costs are tracked via the procedure <tt>with-cost-center</tt>.

<p>
Allocation and instruction counts are tracked only for code instrumented
for that purpose.
This instrumentation is controlled by the <tt>generate-allocation-counts</tt>
and <tt>generate-instruction-counts</tt> parameters.
Instrumentation is disabled by default.
Built in procedures are not instrumented, nor is interpreted code or
non-Scheme code.
Elapsed time is tracked only when the optional <tt>timed?</tt> argument to
<tt>with-cost-center</tt> is provided and is not false.

<p>
The <tt>with-cost-center</tt> procedure accurately tracks costs, subject
to the caveats above, even when reentered with the same cost center, used
simultaneously in multiple threads, and exited or reentered one or more
times via continuation invocation.

<p>
<b>thread parameter:</b> <tt>generate-allocation-counts</tt>

<p>
When this parameter has a true value, the compiler inserts a short sequence of
instructions at each allocation point in generated code to track the amount of
allocation that occurs.
This parameter is initially false.

<p>
<b>thread parameter:</b> <tt>generate-instruction-counts</tt>

<p>
When this parameter has a true value, the compiler inserts a short
sequence of instructions in each block of generated code to track the
number of instructions executed by that block.
This parameter is initially false.

<p>
<b>procedure:</b> <tt>(make-cost-center)</tt>

<p>
Creates a new <tt>cost-center</tt> object with all of its recorded costs
set to zero.

<p>
<b>procedure:</b> <tt>(cost-center?&nbsp;<i>obj</i>)</tt>

<p>
Returns <tt>#t</tt> if <tt><i>obj</i></tt> is a <tt>cost-center</tt> object, otherwise
returns <tt>#f</tt>.

<p>
<b>procedure:</b> <tt>(with-cost-center&nbsp;<i>cost-center</i>&nbsp;<i>thunk</i>)</tt><br>

<b>procedure:</b> <tt>(with-cost-center&nbsp;<i>timed?</i>&nbsp;<i>cost-center</i>&nbsp;<i>thunk</i>)</tt>

<p>
This procedure invokes <tt><i>thunk</i></tt> without arguments and returns its
values.
It also tracks, dynamically, the bytes allocated, instructions executed,
and cpu time elapsed while evaluating the invocation of <tt><i>thunk</i></tt> and
adds the tracked costs to the cost center's running record of these costs.

<p>
Allocation counts are tracked only for code compiled with the parameter
<tt>generate-allocation-counts</tt> set to true, and
instruction counts are tracked only for code compiled with
<tt>generate-instruction-counts</tt> set to true.
Cpu time is tracked only if <tt><i>timed?</i></tt> is provided and not false and
includes cpu time spent in instrumented, uninstrumented, and non-Scheme
code.

<p>
<b>procedure:</b> <tt>(cost-center-instruction-count&nbsp;<i>cost-center</i>)</tt>

<p>
This procedure returns instructions executed recorded by
<tt><i>cost-center</i></tt>.

<p>
<b>procedure:</b> <tt>(cost-center-allocation-count&nbsp;<i>cost-center</i>)</tt>

<p>
This procedure returns the bytes allocated recorded by <tt><i>cost-center</i></tt>.

<p>
<b>procedure:</b> <tt>(cost-center-time&nbsp;<i>cost-center</i>)</tt>

<p>
This procedure returns the cpu time recorded by <tt><i>cost-center</i></tt>.

<p>
<b>procedure:</b> <tt>(reset-cost-center!&nbsp;<i>cost-center</i>)</tt>

<p>
This procedure resets the costs recorded by <tt><i>cost-center</i></tt> to zero.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h146"></a>2.145. Experimental access to hardware performance counters (8.9.1)</h4>




<p>
Two system primitives, <tt>#%$read-time-stamp-counter</tt> and
<tt>#%$read-performance-monitoring-counter</tt>, provide access to the
x86 and x86_64 hardware time-stamp counter register and to the
model-specific performance monitoring registers.

<p>
These primitives rely on instructions that might be restricted to run only in
kernel mode, depending on kernel configuration.
The performance monitoring counters must also be configured to enable
monitoring and to specify which event to monitor.
This can be configured only by instructions executed in kernel mode.

<p>
<b>procedure:</b> <tt>(#%$read-time-stamp-counter)</tt>

<p>
This procedure returns the current value of the time-stamp counter for
the processor core executing this code.
A general protection fault, which manifests as an invalid memory
reference exception, results if this operation is not permitted by
the operating system.

<p>
Since multiple processes might run on the same core between reads of
the time-stamp counter, the counter does not necessarily reflect time
spent only in the current process.
Also, on machines with multiple cores, the executing process might be
swapped to a different core with a different time-stamp counter.

<p>
<b>procedure:</b> <tt>(#%$read-performance-monitoring-counter&nbsp;<i>counter</i>)</tt>

<p>
This procedure returns the current value of the model-specific
performance monitoring register specified by <tt><i>counter</i></tt>.
<tt><i>counter</i></tt> must be a fixnum and should specify a valid performance
monitoring register.
Allowable values depend on the processor model.
A general protection fault, which manifests as an invalid memory
reference exception, results if this operation is not permitted by
the operating system or if the specified counter does not exist.

<p>
In order to get meaningful results, the performance monitoring registers
must be enabled, and the event to be monitored must by configured by
the performance monitoring control register.
This configuration can be done only by code run in kernel mode.

<p>
Since multiple processes might run on the same core between reads of
a performance monitoring register, the register does not necessarily reflect
only the activities of the current process.
Also, on machines with multiple cores, the executing process might be
swapped to a different core with its own set of performance monitoring
registers and possibly a different configuration for those registers.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h147"></a>2.146. New inspector functionality (8.9.1)</h4>




<p>
Within the interactive inspector, closure and frame variables can now
be set by name, and the forward (f) and back (b) commands can now be
used to to move among the frames that comprise a continuation.

<p>
A new show-local (sl) command can be be used to look at just the local
variables of a stack frame.
This contrasts with the show (s) command, which shows the free variables
of the frame's closure as well.

<p>
Errors occurring during inspection, such as attempts to assign immutable
variables, are handled more smoothly than in previous versions.

<p>

<a name="g148"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h148"></a>2.147. Fasl support for records with non-ptr fields (8.4.1)</h4>




<p>
The fasl writer and reader now support records with non-ptr fields,
e.g., integer-32, wchar, etc., allowing constant record instances with
such fields to appear in source code (or be introduced as constants
by macros) into code to be compiled via <tt>compile-file</tt>,
<tt>compile-library</tt>, <tt>compile-program</tt>,
<tt>compile-script</tt>, or <tt>compile-port</tt>.
Ftype-pointer fields are not supported, since storing addresses
in fasl files does not generally make sense.

<h3><a name="./release_notes:h149"></a>3. Bug Fixes</h3>


<a name="section:bugfixes"></a>

<p>

<a name="g150"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h150"></a>3.1. Incorrect assembly code for threaded ARMv5 and earlier (10.1.0)</h4>

architectures has been fixed.

<p>

<a name="g151"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h151"></a>3.2. Index checks in bytevector-reference procedures (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
Bugs that caused an invalid memory reference in <tt>bytevector-reference-ref</tt>,
<tt>bytevector-reference*-ref</tt>, and <tt>bytevector-reference-set!</tt> have been
fixed.

<p>

<a name="g152"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h152"></a>3.3. Repairs for pb32 foreign interface (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
Bugs in the handling of callable addresses and 64-bit arguments and results in pb32 when
using libffi have been fixed.

<p>

<a name="g153"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h153"></a>3.4. Bytecode endianness handling on s390x, m68k, and hppa (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
The bytecode endianness on s390x, m68k, and hppa architectures has been fixed.

<p>

<a name="g154"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h154"></a>3.5. Error message fixes (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
A bug where <tt>flvector</tt> incorrectly reports "non-flonum found" errors as
"non-fixnum found" errors has been fixed.

<p>
Errors for invalid indices in bit operations <tt>bitwise-bit-set?</tt>,
<tt>bitwise-copy-bit</tt>, <tt>logbit?</tt>, <tt>logbit0</tt>, and <tt>logbit1</tt> now
report "invalid bit index" instead of "not an exact integer".

<p>

<a name="g155"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h155"></a>3.6. <tt>with-continuation-mark</tt> key and value expressions (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
A bug in <tt>with-continuation-mark</tt> positioned the key and
value expressions outside of the current continuation marks, which
meant that attempting to look up a continuation mark in the key or
value expression would fail.

<p>

<a name="g156"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h156"></a>3.7. <tt>quote-syntax</tt> incorrectly applies wrap (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
A bug in <tt>quote-syntax</tt> that caused <tt>(identifier?&nbsp;(quote-syntax&nbsp;<i>symbol</i>))</tt>
to report the wrong result has been fixed.

<p>

<a name="g157"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h157"></a>3.8. Repair R<sup>5</sup>RS and IEEE environments (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
The environments returned by <tt>(scheme-report-environment&nbsp;5)</tt>
and <tt>(ieee-environment)</tt> had some names incorrectly
prefixed with <tt>r6rs:</tt>, such as <tt>r6rs:&lt;</tt> instead of
<tt>&lt;</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g158"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h158"></a>3.9. Non-empty mantissa widths (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
Non-empty mantissa widths are now taken into account.  For example,
<tt>(string-&gt;number&nbsp;"#e0.1|1")</tt> now evaluates to <tt>1/8</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g159"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h159"></a>3.10. Case-insensitive "V" format directive (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
The "V" format directive is now recognized in uppercase as well as lowercase.

<p>

<a name="g160"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h160"></a>3.11. Optimization and <tt>debug-level</tt> &ge; 2 (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
When <tt>debug-level</tt> is 2 or higher and <tt>enable-type-recovery</tt> is <tt>#t</tt>
(the default), the compiler could move a call to error from non-tail position to tail
position, which eliminates the stack frame and makes debugging more difficult.
Furthermore, the compiler could also move a call to error from tail position to non-tail
position by optimizations that aim to expose non-error paths.

<p>
Instead of guaranteeing any specific behavior, a <tt>debug-level</tt> value of 2 or higher
is now defined to <i>discourage</i> optimizations that affect the continuation structure
as revealed by the inspector, where the goal is to produce more informative stack traces
at the point where an exception is raised. The implementation produces results that are
more consistent with Chez Scheme 9. Meanwhile, continuation marks support predictable and
well-defined reflection on continuations in a way that is compatible with compiler
optimizations.

<p>

<a name="g161"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h161"></a>3.12. Random number generation for large exact integers (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
Given an exact integer greater than 4294967087,
<tt>pseudo-random-generator-next!</tt> did not produce a valid result.
Generated results did not cover the intended range uniformly, and by
mistreating the largest part of the integer, it could always produce
<tt>0</tt> (e.g., for <tt>(expt&nbsp;2&nbsp;32)</tt>).

<p>

<a name="g162"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h162"></a>3.13. Missing memory fences for some platforms (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
Compilation for tppc32le lacked memory fences that are needed to
ensure safety on multicore machines. The pb machine variant also
needed a more portable approach to memory fences via compiler
intrinsics (as needed for MIPS, for example).

<p>

<a name="g163"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h163"></a>3.14. Bounds checking and collection for some reference-bytevector lengths (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
When a reference bytevector's length is smaller than the machine's
word size, then bounds checking was incorrect in
<tt>bytevector-reference-ref</tt>, <tt>bytevector-reference*-ref</tt>,
and <tt>bytevector-reference-set!</tt>. In addition, the garbage
collector would fail to preserve the last few bytes of a reference
bytevector whose length is not a multiple of the word size.

<p>

<a name="g164"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h164"></a>3.15. Missing C implementation for <tt>Smake_flvector</tt> (10.1.0)</h4>




<p>
The header file scheme.h Scheme defines <tt>Smake_flvector</tt>, but
Chez Scheme does not provide an implmentation. The
<tt>Smake_flvector</tt> function is now implemented.

<p>

<a name="g165"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h165"></a>3.16. <tt>library-exports</tt> for library that is not yet imported (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
When visiting or loading a separately compiled library,
<tt>library-exports</tt> raised an exception if the library was not
yet imported.

<p>

<a name="g166"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h166"></a>3.17. Incorrect code for <tt>record?</tt> at optimize-level 3 (10.0.0)</h4>




<p>
At optimize-level 3, the <tt>record?</tt> predicate could short circuit without
evaluating the <tt><i>rtd</i></tt> expression.

<p>

<a name="g167"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h167"></a>3.18. Incorrect result from <tt>Sinteger64</tt> on 32-bit platforms (9.6.4)</h4>




<p>
On 32-bit platforms, calling <tt>Sinteger64</tt> or <tt>Sunsigned64</tt>
with <tt>0x8000000000000000</tt> could return the wrong value.

<p>

<a name="g168"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h168"></a>3.19. <tt>Sinteger32</tt> and <tt>Sinteger64</tt> return unexpected bignum (9.6.4)</h4>




<p>
When called on a C value equal to <tt>most-negative-fixnum</tt>, <tt>Sinteger32</tt>
and <tt>Sinteger64</tt> could return a bignum where a fixnum is expected.
The values have the same printed representation, yet comparing the resulting bignum with
<tt>most-negative-fixnum</tt> via Scheme's <tt>=</tt> returned false.

<p>

<a name="g169"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h169"></a>3.20. Library-reference import syntax (9.6.4)</h4>




<p>
A bug where <tt>import</tt> did not recognize a <tt><i>library-spec</i></tt>
of the form <tt>(library&nbsp;<i>library-reference</i>)</tt> has been fixed.

<p>

<a name="g170"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h170"></a>3.21. Garbage collector incorrectly handles emphemerons (9.6.0)</h4>




<p>
A bug where the garbage collector sometimes incorrectly handles epehemeron pairs has
been fixed.

<p>

<a name="g171"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h171"></a>3.22. Garbage collector incorrectly handles mutated weak pairs (9.6.0)</h4>




<p>
A bug where the garbage collector sometimes incorrectly handles mutated weak pairs has
been fixed.

<p>

<a name="g172"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h172"></a>3.23. Division by an infinite complex number sometimes incorrectly returns +nan.0 (9.6.0)</h4>




<p>
A bug that caused <tt>/</tt>, <tt>cfl/</tt>, <tt>atan</tt>, and <tt>atanh</tt> to return
an incorrect real or imaginary +nan.0 component has been fixed. The inexact complex number
division routine now uses Robert L. Smith's 1962 algorithm.

<p>

<a name="g173"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h173"></a>3.24. Invalid live-pointer mask for some inline primitive calls (9.6.0)</h4>




<p>
Fixed a crash at optimize-level 2 and higher caused by the compiler generating
an invalid live-pointer mask when inline-expanding certain primitive calls that
store raw data on the stack and whose operands contain calls.

<p>

<a name="g174"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h174"></a>3.25. Optimization bug in <tt>remove</tt>,
  <tt>member</tt> and <tt>assoc</tt> (9.6.0)</h4>




<p>
When <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>member</tt> or <tt>assoc</tt> were used in
optimize-level 3 in a position where the result was discarded,
a bug in the source code optimizer could drop the call even though the first
argument may be a record with a custom equality predicate that has side effects.

<p>

<a name="g175"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h175"></a>3.26. Foreign-callable floating-point argument allocation for x86 (9.6.0)</h4>




<p>
When a foreign callable receives a <tt>double</tt> or <tt>float</tt> argument, the
allocation of space to box the number would try to save the
floating-point return register in the (rare) case that allocation
requires a new page of memory. Saving the return register is harmless on
most platforms, but on x86, a save and restore involves popping then
pushing the x87 register stack, which is invalid if nothing was there
at the start.

<p>

<a name="g176"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h176"></a>3.27. Code generation for a specific branch displacement on ppc32 (9.6.0)</h4>




<p>
Branch generation would go wrong if the displacement was exactly 32,764 bytes.

<p>

<a name="g177"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h177"></a>3.28. <tt>char-</tt> returns negative results (9.6.0)</h4>




<p>
The character difference operator returned a large positive integer in
situations where the first argument is represented by a lower number than the
second argument.  For example: <tt>(char-&nbsp;#\a&nbsp;#\b)</tt> on 64-bit macOS returns
<tt>720575940379279351</tt>.  The fix corrects this, so that it instead
returns <tt>-1</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g178"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h178"></a>3.29. Certain mixed exact/inexact arithmetic comparisons (9.5.8)</h4>




<p>
The arithmetic comparison functions (<tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>, <tt>=</tt>,
<tt>&gt;=</tt>, and <tt>&gt;</tt>) are required to be transitive by the R6RS
specification, but this property was not maintained for <tt>&lt;=</tt>,
<tt>=</tt>, and <tt>&gt;=</tt> comparisons between exact and inexact numbers
in the range where fixnum precision is greater than flonum precision.  For
example, the flonum representation of <tt>9007199254740992.0</tt> and
<tt>9007199254740993.0</tt> is identical, but obviously
<tt>9007199254740992</tt> and <tt>9007199254740993</tt> (which are fixnums
on 64 bit systems) are not.  The arithmetic comparators now no longer
convert comparisons of a fixnum and flonum to comparisons of two flonums
when the fixnum cannot be converted without loss of precision.

<p>

<a name="g179"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h179"></a>3.30. <tt>rational-valued?</tt> and exceptional flonums (9.5.8)</h4>




<p>
The <tt>rational-value?</tt> function returned incorrect results when called on
a value with an inexact zero imaginary part and real part that is an exceptional
floating point value (i.e., an infinity or NaN).  For example,
<tt>(rational-valued?&nbsp;+inf.0+0.0i)</tt> incorrectly returned <tt>#t</tt>, but now
returns <tt>#f</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g180"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h180"></a>3.31. Calls to foreign-callable procedures may cause the process to terminate with
error 0xC0000409 STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN on 64-bit Windows (9.5.8)</h4>




<p>
A interaction bug between Microsoft's longjmp on 64-bit Windows and foreign-callable stack
frames has been fixed.

<p>

<a name="g181"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h181"></a>3.32. Calls to <tt>printf</tt> may cause an invalid memory reference at
compile time (9.5.8)</h4>




<p>
A bug in the compiler that causes an invalid memory reference with particular
<tt>printf</tt> control strings and argument counts has been fixed. One example is
<tt>(printf&nbsp;"~a~:*")</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g182"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h182"></a>3.33. Certain foreign calls with signed 8- and 16-bit integers on x86_64 (9.5.6)</h4>




<p>
The x86_64 code generator now properly sign-extends foreign-call
arguments passed in registers via <tt>(&amp;&nbsp;integer-8)</tt> and <tt>(&amp;&nbsp;integer-16)</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g183"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h183"></a>3.34. Bitwise right shift of negative bignum (9.5.6)</h4>




<p>
When a negative bignum is shifted right by a multiple of the big-digit
bit size (32), a shifted-off bit is non-zero, and the result would be
a sequence of big digits with all one bits before rounding to deal
with the dropped bits, then a carry that should have been delivered to
a new high digit was dropped, producing 0 instead of a negative
number.

<p>
For example, <tt>(ash&nbsp;(-&nbsp;1&nbsp;(ash&nbsp;1&nbsp;64))&nbsp;-32)</tt> no longer returns 0.

<p>

<a name="g184"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h184"></a>3.35. <tt>sleep</tt> with negative duration (9.5.6)</h4>




<p>
Prior to this release, <tt>sleep</tt> of a negative duration would
result in an infinite pause in Windows. Now <tt>sleep</tt> returns
immediately on all platforms when given a negative duration.

<p>

<a name="g185"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h185"></a>3.36. Flonum <tt>remainder</tt> and <tt>modulo</tt> (9.5.6)</h4>




<p>
The <tt>remainder</tt> and <tt>modulo</tt> functions could produce
imprecise or wrong answers for large integer flonums. Most of the
repair was to use the C library's <tt>fmod</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g186"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h186"></a>3.37. Buffering signals (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
Prior to this release, only one unhandled signal was buffered for
any signal for which a handler has been registered via
<tt>register-signal-handler</tt>, so two signals delivered in
quick succession could be seen as only one.
The system now buffers a much larger number (63 in this release) of
signals, and the fact that signals can be dropped has now been
documented.

<p>

<a name="g187"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h187"></a>3.38. Clear-output bug (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
A bug has been fixed in which a call to <tt>clear-output-port</tt>
on a port could lead to unexpected behavior involving the port,
including loss of buffering or suppression of future output to the
port.

<p>

<a name="g188"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h188"></a>3.39. Various argument type-error issues (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
A variety of primitive argument type-checking issues have been
fixed, including missing checks, misleading error messages,
and checks made later than appropriate, i.e., after the primitive
has already had side effects.

<p>

<a name="g189"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h189"></a>3.40. <tt>__collect_safe</tt>, x86_64, and floating-point arguments or results (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
The <tt>__collect_safe</tt> mode for a foreign call or callable now
correctly preserves floating-point registers used for arguments or
results while activating or deactivating a thread on x86_64.

<p>

<a name="g190"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h190"></a>3.41. <tt>putenv</tt> memory leak (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
<tt>putenv</tt> now calls the host system's <tt>setenv</tt> instead of
<tt>putenv</tt> on non-Windows hosts and avoids allocating memory that
is never freed, although <tt>setenv</tt> might do so.

<p>

<a name="g191"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h191"></a>3.42. String ports from immutable strings (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
A bug that miscalculated the buffer size for
<tt>open-string-input-port</tt> given an immutable string has been
fixed.

<p>

<a name="g192"></a>

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h195"></a>3.46. Fasl representation change for recursive ftypes (9.5.2)</h4>




<p>
A bug in the reading of mutually recursive ftype definitions from
compiled files has been fixed.
The bug was triggered by recursive ftype definitions in which one
of the mutually recursive ftypes is a subtype of another, as in:

<p>

<p><tt>(define-ftype<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;[A&nbsp;(*&nbsp;B)]<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;[B&nbsp;(struct&nbsp;[h&nbsp;A])]))</tt>
<p>It manifested in the fasl reader raising bogus "incompatible record
type" exceptions when two or more references to one of the ftypes
occur in in separate compiled files or in separate top-level forms
of a file compiled via <tt>compile-file</tt>.
The bug could also have affected other record-type descriptors with
cycles involving parent rtds and "extra" fields as well as fasl
output created via <tt>fasl-write</tt>.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h196"></a>3.47. Unbound object resulting from libraries combined with <tt>compile-whole-library</tt> (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
A bug in <tt>compile-whole-library</tt> that allowed the invoke code for a
library included in the combined library body to be executed without first
invoking its binary library dependencies has been fixed.
This bug could arise when a member of a combined library was invoked without
invoking the requirements of the other libraries it was combined with.  For
instance, consider the case where libraries <tt>(A)</tt> and <tt>(B)</tt> are
combined and <tt>(B)</tt> has dependencies on library <tt>(A)</tt> and binary
library <tt>(C)</tt>.
One possible sort order of this graph is <tt>(C)</tt>, <tt>(A)</tt>,
<tt>(B)</tt>, where the invoke code for <tt>(A)</tt> and <tt>(B)</tt> are
combined into a single block of invoke code.  If library <tt>(A)</tt> is
invoked first, it will implicitly cause the invoke code for <tt>(B)</tt> to be
invoked without invoking the code for <tt>(C)</tt>.
We address this by adding explicit dependencies between <tt>(A)</tt> and all
the binary libraries that precede it and all of the other libraries clustered
with <tt>(A)</tt> and <tt>(A)</tt>, such that no matter which library clustered
with <tt>(A)</tt> is invoked first, <tt>(A)</tt> will be invoked, causing all
binary libraries that precede <tt>(A)</tt> to be invoked.
It is also possible for a similar problem to exist between clusters, where
invoking a later cluster may invoke an earlier cluster without invoking the
binary dependencies for the earlier cluster.
We address this issue by adding an invoke requirement between each cluster and
the first library in the cluster that precedes it.
These extended invoke requirements are also added to the import requirements
for each library, and the dependency graph is enhanced with import requirement
links to ensure these are taken into account during the topological sort.

<p>
A bug in automatic recompilation involving missing include files
has been fixed.
The bug caused automatic recompilation to fail, often with an

A bug in the source optimizer (cp0) allowed constant-folding of some calls to
<tt>apply</tt> where the last argument is not known to be a list.  For example,
cp0 incorrectly reduced
<tt>(apply&nbsp;zero?&nbsp;0)</tt> to <tt>#t</tt>
and reduced
<tt>(lambda&nbsp;(x)&nbsp;(apply&nbsp;box?&nbsp;x)&nbsp;x)</tt> to <tt>(lambda&nbsp;(x)&nbsp;x)</tt>,
but now preserves these calls to <tt>apply</tt> so that they may raise an

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h200"></a>3.51. Disk-relative filenames in Windows (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
In Windows, filenames that start with a disk designator but no
directory separator are now treated as relative paths. For example,
<tt>(path-absolute?&nbsp;"C:")</tt> now returns <tt>#f</tt>, and
<tt>(directory-list&nbsp;"C:")</tt> now lists the files in the current
directory on disk C instead of the files in the root directory of disk
C.

<p>
In addition, <tt>file-access-time</tt>, <tt>file-change-time</tt>,

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h205"></a>3.56. Misleading cyclic dependency error (9.5)</h4>




<p>
The library system no longer reports a cyclic dependency error
during the second and subsequent attempts to visit or invoke a
library after the first attempt fails for some reason other than
an actual cyclic dependency.
The fix also allows a library to be visited or invoked successfully
on the second or subsequent attempt if the visit or invoke failed
for a transient reason, such as a missing or incorrect version in
an imported library.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h220"></a>3.71. <tt>string-&gt;number</tt> and reader numeric syntax issues (9.4)</h4>




<p>
<tt>string-&gt;number</tt> and the reader previously treated all complex
numbers written in polar notation that Chez Scheme cannot represent
exactly as inexact, even with an explicit <tt>#e</tt> prefix.
For such numbers with the <tt>#e</tt> prefix, <tt>string-&gt;number</tt>
now returns <tt>#f</tt> and the reader now raises an exception with
condition type <tt>&amp;implementation-restriction</tt>.
Both still return an inexact representation for such numbers written without
the <tt>#e</tt> prefix, even if R6RS requires an exact result, i.e.,
even if they have no decimal point, exponent, or mantissa width.

<p>
Ratios with an exponent, like <tt>1/2e10</tt>, are non-standard and
now cause the procedure <tt>string-&gt;number</tt> imported from
<tt>(rnrs)</tt> to return <tt>#f</tt>.
When the reader encounters a ratio followed by an exponent while in R6RS
mode (i.e., when reading a library or top-level program and not following
an <tt>#!chezscheme</tt>, or when following an explicit <tt>#!r6rs</tt>),
it raises an exception.

<p>
Positive or negative zero followed by a large exponent now properly
produces zero rather than an infinity, e.g., <tt>0e3000</tt> now produces
<tt>0</tt> rather than <tt>+inf.0</tt>.

<p>
A rounding bug converting some small ratios into floating point numbers,
when those numbers fall into the range of denormalized floats, has
been fixed.
This bug also affected the reading of and conversion of strings into
denormalized floating-point numbers.

A deficiency in the handling of library dependencies that prevented meta
definitions exported in one library from being used reliably by a macro
defined in another library has been fixed.
Handling imported meta bindings involves tracking
visit-visit-requirements, which for a library <tt>(A)</tt> is the set of

<a name="g236"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h236"></a>4.1. Reduced allocation and copying (9.6.0)</h4>




<p>
When given a bytevector whose length is less than <tt>file-buffer-size</tt>,
<tt>bytevector-&gt;string</tt> now allocates the minimum size string buffer,
internal ioffsets fxvector, and internal codec buffer.
The size of each was formerly hardcoded at 1024.
The
<tt>bytevector-&gt;string</tt>,
<tt>get-bytevector-all</tt>,
<tt>get-bytevector-n</tt>,
<tt>get-string-all</tt>, and
<tt>get-string-n</tt> procedures
may avoid extra allocation and copying when the result is not more than
<tt>file-buffer-size</tt> and no intermediate reads need to be stitched
together to form the result.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h237"></a>4.2. Special-cased basic arithmetic operations (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
The basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division) are now much faster when presented with certain special
cases, e.g., multiplication of a large integer by 1 or -1 or addition
of large integer and 0.

<p>

<a name="g238"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h238"></a>4.3. Faster right-shift of large integers (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
Right shifting a large integer is now much faster in most cases
where the shift count is a significant fraction of the number of
bits in the large integer.

<p>

<a name="g239"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h239"></a>4.4. Faster object-file loading (9.5.4)</h4>


<a name="sec:faster-object-file-loading"></a>

<p>
Visiting an object file (to obtain only compile-time information and
code) and revisiting an object file (to obtain only run-time information
and code) is now faster, because revisions to the fasl format, fasl
writer, and fasl reader allow run-time code to be seeked past when
visiting and compile-time code to be seeked past when revisiting.
For compressed object files (the default), seeking still requires
reading all of the data, but the cost of parsing the fasl format and
building objects in the skipped portions is avoided, as are certain
side effects, such as associating record type descriptors with their
uids.

<p>
Similarly, recompile information is now placed at the front of each
object file where it can be loaded separately from
the remainder of an object file without even seeking past the other
portions of the file.
Recompile information is used by <tt>import</tt> (when
<tt>compile-imported-libraries</tt> is <tt>#t</tt>) and by maybe-compile
routines such as <tt>maybe-compile-program</tt> to help determine
whether recompilation is necessary.

<p>
Importing a library from an object file now causes the object file
to be visited rather than fully loaded.  (Libraries were already
just revisited when required for their run-time code, e.g., when
used from a top-level program.)

<p>
Together these changes can significantly reduce compile-time and
run-time overhead, particularly in applications that make use of
a large number of libraries.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h240"></a>4.5. Faster <tt>profile-release-counters</tt> (9.5.4)</h4>




<p>
<tt>profile-release-counters</tt> is now generation-friendly, meaning
it does not incur any overhead for code objects in generations that
have not been collected since the last call to<tt>profile-release-counters</tt>.
Also, it no longer allocates memory when counters are released.

<p>

<a name="g241"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h241"></a>4.6. Reduced cost for obtaining profile counts (9.5.4)</h4>

<a name="g242"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h242"></a>4.7. Better code for <tt>bytevector</tt> (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
The compiler now generates better inline code for the <tt>bytevector</tt>
procedure.
Instead of one byte memory write for each argument, it writes up
to four (32-bit machines) or eight (64-bit machines) bytes at a
time, which almost always results in fewer instructions and fewer
writes.

The last call to the procedure passed to <tt>vector-for-each</tt>
or <tt>string-for-each</tt> is now reliably implemented as tail
call, as was already the case for <tt>for-each</tt>.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h244"></a>4.9. Lambda commonization (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
After running the main source optimization pass (cp0), the
compiler optionally runs a <i>commonization</i> pass, which
commonizes code for similar lambda expressions.
The parameter <tt>commonization-level</tt> controls whether the
commonization pass is run and, if so, how aggressive it is.
The parameter's value must be a nonnegative exact integer ranging
from 0 through 9.  When the parameter is set to 0, the default,
commonization is not run.  Otherwise, higher values result in more
commonization.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h245"></a>4.10. Improved compile times (9.5.1)</h4>




<p>
Compile times are now lower, sometimes by an order of magnitude or
more, for procedures with thousands of parameters, local variables,
and compiler-introduced temporaries.
For such procedures, the register/frame allocator proactively spills
variables with large live ranges, cutting down on the size and cost
of building the conflict graph used to represent pairs of variables
that are live at the same time and therefore cannot share a location.

<p>

<a name="g246"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h246"></a>4.11. Improved oblist management (9.3.3)</h4>




<p>
As a result of improvements in the handing of the oblist (symbol table),
the storage for a symbol is often reclaimed more quickly after it
becomes inaccessible, less space is set aside for the oblist at
start-up, oblist lookups are faster when the oblist contains a large
number of symbols, and the minimum cost of a maximum-generation
collection has been cut significantly, down from tens of microseconds
to just a handful on contemporary hardware.

<p>

<a name="g247"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h247"></a>4.12. Reduced maximum-generation collection overhead (9.3.3)</h4>




<p>
Various changes in the storage manager have reduced the amount of
extra memory required for managing heap storage and increased the
likelihood that memory can be returned to the O/S as the heap
shrinks.
Returning memory to the O/S is now faster, so the minimum time for
a maximum-generation collection, or any other collection where
release of memory to the O/S is enabled, has been cut.

<p>

<a name="g248"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h248"></a>4.13. Faster library load times (9.3.1)</h4>




<p>
Libraries now load faster at both compile and run time, with more
pronounced improvements when dozens of libraries or more are being
loaded.

<p>

<a name="g249"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h249"></a>4.14. Partially static record instances (9.3.1)</h4>




<p>
The source optimizer now maintains information about partially static
record instances to eliminate field accesses and type checks when a
binding site for a record instance is visible to the access or checking
code.
For example,

<p>

<p><tt>(let&nbsp;()<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;(import&nbsp;scheme)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;(define-record&nbsp;foo&nbsp;([immutable&nbsp;ptr&nbsp;a]&nbsp;[immutable&nbsp;ptr&nbsp;b]))<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;(define&nbsp;(inc&nbsp;r)&nbsp;(make-foo&nbsp;(foo-a&nbsp;r)&nbsp;(+&nbsp;(foo-b&nbsp;r)&nbsp;1)))<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;(lambda&nbsp;(x)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(let*&nbsp;([r&nbsp;(make-foo&nbsp;37&nbsp;x)]<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[r&nbsp;(inc&nbsp;r)]<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[r&nbsp;(inc&nbsp;r)])<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r)))</tt>
<p>is reduced by the source optimizer down to:

<p>

<p><tt>(lambda&nbsp;(x)&nbsp;($record&nbsp;'#&lt;record&nbsp;type&nbsp;foo&gt;&nbsp;37&nbsp;(+&nbsp;(+&nbsp;x&nbsp;1)&nbsp;1)))</tt>
<p>where <tt>$record</tt> is a low-level primitive for creating record
instances.
That is, the source optimizer eliminates the intermediate record
structures, record references, and type checks, in addition to
creating the record-type descriptor at compile time, eliminating
the record-constructor descriptor, record constructor, and record
accessors produced by expansion of the record definition.

<p>

<a name="g250"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h250"></a>4.15. More source-optimizer improvements (9.3.1)</h4>




<p>
The source optimizer now handles <tt>apply</tt> with a known-list
final argument, e.g., a constant list or list constructed directly
within the apply operation via <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>list</tt>, or
<tt>list*</tt> (<tt>cons*</tt>) as if it were an ordinary call,
i.e., without the <tt>apply</tt> and without the constant list
wrapper or list constructor.
For example:

<p>

<p><tt>(apply&nbsp;apply&nbsp;apply&nbsp;+&nbsp;(list&nbsp;1&nbsp;(cons&nbsp;2&nbsp;(list&nbsp;x&nbsp;(cons*&nbsp;4&nbsp;'(5&nbsp;6))))))</tt>
<p>folds down to <tt>(+&nbsp;18&nbsp;x)</tt>.
While not common at the source level, patterns like this can
materialize as the result of other source optimizations,
particularly inlining.

<p>
The source optimizer now also reduces applications of <tt>car</tt> and
<tt>cdr</tt> to the list-building operators <tt>cons</tt> and
<tt>list</tt>, e.g.:

<p>

<p><tt>(car&nbsp;(cons&nbsp;<i>e<sub>1</sub></i>&nbsp;<i>e<sub>2</sub></i>))&nbsp;<img src="math/release_notes/1.gif" alt="<graphic>">&nbsp;(begin&nbsp;<i>e<sub>2</sub></i>&nbsp;<i>e<sub>1</sub></i>)<br>

(car&nbsp;(list&nbsp;<i>e<sub>1</sub></i>&nbsp;<i>e<sub>2</sub></i>&nbsp;<i>e<sub>3</sub></i>))&nbsp;<img src="math/release_notes/1.gif" alt="<graphic>">&nbsp;(begin&nbsp;<i>e<sub>2</sub></i>&nbsp;<i>e<sub>3</sub></i>&nbsp;<i>e<sub>1</sub></i>)<br>

(cdr&nbsp;(list&nbsp;<i>e<sub>1</sub></i>&nbsp;<i>e<sub>2</sub></i>&nbsp;<i>e<sub>3</sub></i>))&nbsp;<img src="math/release_notes/1.gif" alt="<graphic>">&nbsp;(begin&nbsp;<i>e<sub>1</sub></i>&nbsp;(list&nbsp;<i>e<sub>2</sub></i>&nbsp;<i>e<sub>3</sub></i>))</tt>
<p>discarding side-effect-free expressions in the <tt>begin</tt> forms
where appropriate.
It treats similarly calls of <tt>vector-ref</tt> on <tt>vector</tt>;
<tt>list-ref</tt> on <tt>list</tt>, <tt>list*</tt>, and <tt>cons*</tt>;
<tt>string-ref</tt> on <tt>string</tt>; and <tt>fxvector-ref</tt>
on <tt>fxvector</tt>, taking care with <tt>string-ref</tt> and
<tt>fxvector-ref</tt> not to optimize when doing so might mask an
invalid type of argument to a safe constructor.

<p>
Finally, the source optimizer now removes certain unnecessary
<tt>let</tt> bindings within the constraints of evaluation-order
preservation.
For example,

<p>

<p><tt>(let&nbsp;([x&nbsp;<i>e<sub>1</sub></i>]&nbsp;[y&nbsp;<i>e<sub>2</sub></i>])&nbsp;(list&nbsp;(cons&nbsp;x&nbsp;y)&nbsp;7))</tt>
<p>reduces to:

<p>

<p><tt>(list&nbsp;(cons&nbsp;<i>e<sub>1</sub></i>&nbsp;<i>e<sub>2</sub></i>)&nbsp;7)</tt>
<p>Such bindings commonly arise from inlining.  Eliminating them tends
to make the output of <tt>expand/optimize</tt> more readable.

<p>
The impact on performance is minimal, but it can result in smaller
expressions and thus enable more inlining within the same size limits.

<h4><a name="./release_notes:h251"></a>4.16. Improved foreign-pointer address handling (9.3.1)</h4>




<p>
Various composed operation on ftypes now avoid allocating
and dereferencing intermediate ftype pointers, i.e., <tt>ftype-ref</tt>,
<tt>ftype-set!</tt>, <tt>ftype-init-lock!</tt>, <tt>ftype-lock!</tt>,
<tt>ftype-unlock!</tt>, <tt>ftype-spin-lock!</tt>,
<tt>ftype-locked-incr!</tt>, or <tt>ftype-locked-decr!</tt> applied
directly to the result of <tt>ftype-ref</tt>, <tt>ftype-&amp;ref</tt>, or
<tt>make-ftype-pointer</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g252"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h252"></a>4.17. New source optimizations (9.2.1)</h4>




<p>
The source optimizer does a few new optimizations: it folds
calls to <tt>symbol-&gt;string</tt>, <tt>string-&gt;symbol</tt>, and
<tt>gensym-&gt;unique-string</tt> if the argument is known at compile
time and has the right type; it folds zero-argument calls to
<tt>vector</tt>, <tt>string</tt>, <tt>bytevector</tt>, and
<tt>fxvector</tt>; and it discards subsumed case-lambda clauses,
e.g., the second clause in
<tt>(case-lambda&nbsp;[(x&nbsp;.&nbsp;y)&nbsp;<i>e<sub>1</sub></i>]&nbsp;[(x&nbsp;y)&nbsp;<i>e<sub>2</sub></i>])</tt>.

<p>

<a name="g253"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h253"></a>4.18. Reduced stack requirements after large apply (9.2)</h4>




<p>
A call to <tt>apply</tt> with a very long argument list can cause a
large chunk of memory to be allocated for the topmost portion of
the stack.
This space is now reclaimed during the next collection.

<p>

<a name="g254"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h254"></a>4.19. Improved symbol-hashtables performance (9.2)<a name="sec:symbol-hashtable-performance"></a></h4>




<p>
The performance of operations on symbol hashtables has been improved
generally over previous releases by eliminating call overhead for the
hash and equality functions.
Further improvements are possible with the use of the new type-specific
symbol-hashtable operators (Section&nbsp;<a href="./release_notes.html#g99">2.98</a>).

<p>

<a name="g255"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h255"></a>4.20. Reduced library-invocation time, memory consumption (9.1)</h4>




<p>
The amount of time required to invoke a library and the amount of memory
occupied by the library when the library is invoked as the result of a
run-time dependency of another library or a top-level program have both
been reduced by "revisiting" rather than "invoking" the library,
effectively leaving the compile-time information on disk until if and
when it is needed.

<p>

<a name="g256"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h256"></a>4.21. Discarding relocation tables for static code objects (9.1)</h4>




<p>
Unless the command-line parameter <tt>--retain-static-relocation</tt>
is supplied, the collector now discards relocation tables for code
objects when the code objects are promoted to the static generation,
either at boot time via heap compaction or via a call to <tt>collect</tt>
with the symbol <tt>static</tt> as the target generation.
This results in a significant reduction in the memory occupied by the
code object (around 20% in our tests).

<p>

<a name="g257"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h257"></a>4.22. Guardian registration (9.1)</h4>




<p>
The code to register an object with a guardian is now open-coded, at
the cost of some additional work during the next collection.
The result is a modest net improvement in registration overhead (around
15% in our tests).
Of potentially greater importance when threaded, each registration no
longer requires synchronization.

<p>

<a name="g258"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h258"></a>4.23. Generated code improvements (9.1)</h4>




<p>
The compiler generates better code in several small ways, resulting
in small decreases in code size and corresponding small
performance improvements in the range of 1-5% in our tests.

<p>

<a name="g259"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h259"></a>4.24. Reduced collector overhead for large heaps (9.0)</h4>




<p>
In previous releases, a factor in collector performance was the
overall size of the heap (measured both in number of pages and the
amount of virtual memory spanned by the heap).
Through various changes to the data structures used to support the
storage manager, this factor has been eliminated, which can
significantly reduce the cost of collecting a younger generation
with a small number of accessible objects relative to overall heap
size.
In our experiments, the minimum cost of collection on contemporary
hardware exceeded 100 microseconds for heaps of 64MB or more and 5
milliseconds for heaps of 1GB or more.
The minimum cost grew in proportion to the heap size from there.
This is now fixed for all heap sizes at just a few microseconds.

<p>

<a name="g260"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h260"></a>4.25. Reduced mutation overhead (9.0)</h4>




<p>
Improvements in the compiler and storage manager have been made to
reduce the cost of tracking possible pointers from older to younger
generations when objects are mutated.

<p>

<a name="g261"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h261"></a>4.26. Improved foreign-pointer address handling (8.9.5)<a name="ftpaopt"></a></h4>




<p>
Ftype pointers with constant addresses are now created at compile
time, with ftype-pointer address checks optimized away as well.

<p>
Bignum allocation overhead is avoided for addresses outside the
fixnum range when the results of two <tt>ftype-pointer-address</tt>
calls are directly compared or the result of one
<tt>ftype-pointer-address</tt> call is directly compared with 0.
That is, comparisons like:

<p>

<p><tt>(=&nbsp;(ftype-pointer-address&nbsp;x)&nbsp;0)<br>

(=&nbsp;(ftype-pointer-address&nbsp;x)&nbsp;(ftype-pointer-address&nbsp;y))</tt>
<p>are effectively optimized to:

<p>

<p><tt>(ftype-pointer-null?&nbsp;x)<br>

(ftype-pointer=?&nbsp;x&nbsp;y)</tt>
<p>This optimization is performed when the comparison procedure is
<tt>=</tt>, <tt>eqv?</tt>, or <tt>equal?</tt> and the arguments
are given in either order.
The optimization is also performed when <tt>zero?</tt> is applied directly
to the result of <tt>ftype-pointer-address</tt>.

<p>
Bignum allocation overhead is also avoided at optimize-level&nbsp;3
when <tt>ftype-pointer-address</tt> is used in combination with
<tt>make-ftype-pointer</tt> to effect a type cast, as in:

<p>

<p><tt>(make-ftype-pointer&nbsp;T&nbsp;(ftype-pointer-address&nbsp;x))</tt>
<p>Both bignum and ftype-pointer allocation is avoided when the result
of such a cast is used directly as the base pointer in an
<tt>ftype-ref</tt>, <tt>ftype-&amp;ref</tt>, <tt>ftype-set!</tt>,
<tt>ftype-locked-incr!</tt>, <tt>ftype-locked-decr!</tt>,
<tt>ftype-init-lock!</tt>, <tt>ftype-lock!</tt>, <tt>ftype-spin-lock!</tt>,
or <tt>ftype-unlock!</tt> form, as in:

<p>

<p><tt>(ftype-ref&nbsp;T&nbsp;(fld)&nbsp;(make-ftype-pointer&nbsp;T&nbsp;(ftype-pointer-address&nbsp;x)))</tt>
<p>These optimizations do not occur when the calls to
<tt>ftype-pointer-address</tt> are not nested directly within the outer
form, as when a <tt>let</tt> binding is used to name the result of the
<tt>ftype-pointer-address</tt> call, e.g.:

<p>

<p><tt>(let&nbsp;([addr&nbsp;(ftype-pointer-address&nbsp;x)])&nbsp;(=&nbsp;addr&nbsp;0))</tt>
<p>In other places where <tt>ftype-pointer-address</tt> is used, the compiler
now open-codes the extraction and (if necessary) bignum allocation,
reducing overhead by the cost of a procedure call.

<p>

<a name="g262"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h262"></a>4.27. Improved performance when profiling (8.9.5)</h4>




<p>
In addition to improvements in the tracking of profile counts, the
run-time overhead for gathering profile information has gone down by
5-10% in our tests and is now typically around 10% of the total
unprofiled run time.
(Unprofiled code is also slightly faster, but by less than 2% in
our tests.)

<p>

<a name="g263"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h263"></a>4.28. New compiler back-end (8.9.1, 8.9.2, 8.9.5)</h4>




<p>
Versions starting with 8.9.1 employ a new compiler back end that is
structured as a series of nanopasses and replaces the old linear-time
register allocator with a graph-coloring register allocator.
Compilation with the new back end is substantially slower (up to a factor
of two) than with the old back end, while code generated with the new
back end is faster (14-40% depending on architecture and optimization
level) in our tests.
These improvements are independent of improvements
resulting from cross-library constant folding and inlining
(Section&nbsp;<a href="./release_notes.html#g266">4.31</a>).
The code generated for a specific program might be faster or slower.

<p>

<a name="g264"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h264"></a>4.29. Open-coding of <tt>make-guardian</tt> (8.9.4)</h4>




<p>
Calls to <tt>make-guardian</tt> are now open-coded by the compiler to
expose the implicit resulting <tt>case-lambda</tt> expression so that
calls to the guardian can themselves be inlined, thus reducing the overhead
for registering objects with a guardian and querying the guardian for
resurrected objects.

<p>

<a name="g265"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h265"></a>4.30. Improved open-coding of <tt>make-parameter</tt> and <tt>make-thread-parameter</tt> (8.9.4)</h4>




<p>
<tt>make-parameter</tt> and <tt>make-thread-parameter</tt>
are now open-coded in all cases to expose the implicit resulting
<tt>case-lambda</tt> expression.
(They were already open-coded when the second, <i>filter</i>,
argument was a <tt>lambda</tt> expression or primitive name.)

<p>

<a name="g266"></a>


<h4><a name="./release_notes:h266"></a>4.31. Cross-library constant folding and inlining (8.9.2)<a name="subsection:clcfai"></a></h4>




<p>
The compiler now propagates constants and inlines simple procedures
across library boundaries.
A simple procedure is one that, after optimization of the exporting
library, is smaller than a given threshold, contains no free references
to other bindings in the exporting library, and contains no constants
that cannot be copied without breaking pointer identity.
The size threshold is determined, as for inlining within a library or
other compilation unit, by the parameter <tt>cp0-score-limit</tt>.
In this case, the size threshold is determined based on the size
<i>before</i> inlining rather than the size <i>after</i> inlining,
which is often more conservative.
Omitting larger procedures that might generate less code when inlined in
a particular context reduces the amount of information that must be stored
in the exporting library's object code to support cross-library inlining.

<p>
One particularly useful benefit of this optimization is that record
predicates, accessors, mutators, and (depending on protocols)
constructors created by a record definition in one library and exported
by another are inlined in the importing library, just as if the record
type were defined in the importing library.
