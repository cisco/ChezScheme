.SH NAME
\fIChez Scheme\fP
.br
\fIPetite Chez Scheme\fP
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB{InstallSchemeName}\fP [ \fIoptions\fP ] \fIfile\fP ...
.br
\fB{InstallPetiteName}\fP [ \fIoptions\fP ] \fIfile\fP ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*s is a programming language, based on R6RS Scheme, and a
high-performance implementation of that language.
\*s compiles source expressions \fIincrementally\fP to machine code,
providing the speed of compiled code in an interactive system.
.LP
\*p is an interpreted version of \*s that may be
used as a run-time environment for \*s applications or as a
stand-alone Scheme system.
With the exception that the compiler is not present, \*p is 100%
compatible with \*s.
Interpreted code is fast in \*p, but generally not nearly as fast as
compiled code.
Debugging and profiling support is also limited for interpreted
code.
.LP
Scheme is normally used interactively.  The system prompts
the user with a right angle bracket (\*(lq>\*(rq) at the beginning of each
input line.  Any Scheme expression may be entered.  The system evaluates
the expression and prints the result.  After printing
the result, the system prompts again for more input.
The user can exit the system by typing 
Control-D or by using the procedure \fIexit\fP.
.SH COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
.LP
\*s recognizes the following command line options:
.TP 1i
.B -q, --quiet
Suppress greeting and prompts.
.TP
.B --script \fIfile\fP
Run \fIfile\fP as a shell script.
.TP

.TP
.B --help

.LP
The following options are recognized but cause the system to print an
error message and exit because saved heaps are not presently supported.
.TP 1in
.B -h \fIfile\fP, --heap \fIfile\fP
.TP
.B -s[\fIlevel\fP] \fIfile\fP, --saveheap[\fIlevel\fP] \fIfile\fP
.TP
.B -c, --compact
.LP
Any remaining command-line arguments are treated as the names of
files to be loaded before Chez Scheme begins interacting with the
user (see COMMAND-LINE FILE ARGUMENTS), unless \*(lq--script\*(rq or
\*(lq--program\*(rq is present, in which case the remaining arguments
are made available to the script via the \fIcommand-line\fP parameter
(see SCHEME SCRIPTS).
.SH WAITERS and CAFES
.LP
Interaction of the system with the user is performed
by a Scheme program called a \fIwaiter\fP, running in a
program state called a \fI\*c\fP.  The waiter
merely prompts, reads, evaluates, prints and loops
back for more.  It is possible to open up a chain of \*s
\*cs by invoking the \fInew-cafe\fP procedure with no arguments.
New-cafe is also one of the options when an interrupt
occurs.  Each \*c has its own reset and exit procedures.
Exiting from one \*c in the chain returns you to the next one
back, and so on, until the entire chain closes and you leave the
system altogether.  Sometimes it is useful to
interrupt a long computation by typing the interrupt character,
enter a new \*c to execute something (perhaps to check a status
variable set by computation), and exit the \*c back to the old
computation.
.LP
You can tell what level you are at by the number of angle brackets
in the prompt, one for level one, two for level two, and so on.
Three angle brackets in the prompt means you would have to exit from
three \*cs to get out of \*s.  If you wish to abort
from \*s and you are several \*cs deep, the procedure
\fIabort\fP leaves the system directly.
.LP
You can exit the system by typing the end-of-file character
(normally Control-D) or by using the procedure \fIexit\fP.
Typing Control-D is equivalent to (exit), (exit (void)), or
(exit 0), each of which is considered a \*(lqnormal exit\*(rq.
.SH DEBUGGER
Ordinarily, if an exception occurs during interactive use of the system,
the default exception handler displays
the condition with which the exception was raised, saves it for
possibly later use by the debugger, and prints the message
"type (debug) to enter the debugger."
Once in the debugger, the user has the option of inspecting the
raise continuation, i.e., the stack frames of the pending calls.
When an exception occurs in a script or top level program, or when the
standard input and/or output ports are redirected, the default exception
handler does not save the continuation of the exception and does not print
the "type (debug)" message.
.LP
If the parameter debug-on-exception is set to #t, however, the default
exception handler directly invokes debug, whether running interactively or
not, and even when running a script or top-level program.
The \*(lq--debug-on-exception\*(rq option may be used to set
debug-on-exception to #t from the command line, which is particularly
useful when debugging scripts or top-level programs run via the
\*(lq--script\*(rq or \*(lq--program\*(rq  options.
.LP
None of this applies to exceptions raised with a non-serious (warning)
condition, for which the default exception handler simply displays the
condition and returns.
.SH KEYBOARD INTERRUPTS
Running programs may be interrupted by typing the interrupt
character (normally Control-C).   In response, the
system enters a break handler, which prompts for input with a
\*(lqbreak>\*(rq prompt.
Several commands may be issued to the break handler, including
\*(lqe\*(rq to exit from the handler and continue,
\*(lqr\*(rq to reset to the current \*c,
\*(lqa\*(rq to abort \*s,
\*(lqn\*(rq to enter a new \*c,
\*(lqi\*(rq to inspect the current continuation, and
\*(lqs\*(rq to display statistics about the interrupted program.
While typing an expression to the waiter, the interrupt character
simply resets to the current \*c.
.SH EXPRESSION EDITOR
.LP
When \*s is used interactively in a 
shell window, the waiter's \*(lqprompt and read\*(rq
procedure employs an expression editor that permits entry and editing of
single- and multiple-line expressions, automatically indents expressions
as they are entered, and supports name-completion based on the identifiers
defined in the interactive environment.
The expression editor also maintains a history of expressions typed during
and across sessions and supports tcsh(1)-like history movement and search
commands.
Other editing commands include simple cursor movement via
arrow keys, deletion of characters via backspace and delete, and
movement, deletion, and other commands using mostly
emacs key bindings.
.LP
The expression editor does not run if the TERM environment variable is
not set, if the standard input or output files have been redirected, or
if the --eedisable command-line option has been used.
The history is saved across sessions, by default, in the file
\*(lq$HOME/.chezscheme_history\*(rq.
The --eehistory command-line option
can be used to specify a different
location for the history file or to disable the saving and restoring of
the history file.
.LP
Keys for nearly all printing characters (letters, digits, and special
characters) are \*(lqself inserting\*(rq by default.
The open parenthesis, close parenthesis, open bracket, and close bracket
keys are self inserting as well, but also cause the editor to \*(lqflash\*(rq
to the matching delimiter, if any.
Furthermore, when a close parenthesis or close bracket is typed, it is
automatically corrected to match the corresponding open delimiter, if any.
.LP
Key bindings for other keys and key sequences initially recognized by
the expression editor are given below, organized into groups by function.
Some keys or key sequences serve more than one purpose depending upon
context.
For example, tab is used both for identifier completion and for
indentation.
Such bindings are shown in each applicable functional group.
.LP
Multiple-key sequences are displayed with hyphens between the keys of
the sequences, but these hyphens should not be entered.
When two or more key sequences perform the same operation, the sequences
are shown separated by commas.
.LP
Newlines, acceptance, exiting, and redisplay:
.LP
.ta \w'{xxxxxxxxxxxxx}'u+.25i
enter, ^M	 accept balanced entry if used at end of entry;
.br
	 else add a newline before the cursor and indent
.br
^J	 accept entry unconditionally
.br

.br
right, ^F	 move cursor right
.br
up, ^P	 move cursor up; from top of unmodified entry,
.br
	 move to preceding history entry.
.br
down, ^N	 move cursor down; from bottom of unmodified entry,
.br

.br
	 of a line, join with next line
.br

.LP
When used on the first line of a multiline entry of which only the first line
is displayed, i.e., immediately after history movement, ^U deletes the
contents of the entire entry, like ^G (described below).

.br
tab-tab	 show possible identifier completions at end of
.br
	 identifier just typed, else re-indent
.br

.LP
If at end of existing identifier, i.e., not one just typed, the first tab
re-indents, the second tab inserts identifier completion, and the third
shows possible completions.
.br
.LP
History movement:
.LP
.ta \w'{xxxxxxxxxxxxx}'u+.25i
up, ^P	 move to preceding entry if at top of unmodified
.br
	 entry; else move up within entry

esc-N	 search forward through history for given string
.br
.LP
To search, enter a prefix or string followed by one of the search key
sequences.
Follow with additional search key sequences to search further backward or
forward in the history.
For example, enter \*(lq(define\*(rq followed by one or more esc-p key sequences
to search backward for entries that are definitions, or \*(lq(define\*(rq
followed by one or more esc-P key sequences for entries that contain
definitions.
.br

esc-f, esc-F	 move cursor to end of next word
.br
esc-b, esc-B	 move cursor to start of preceding word

^Y	 insert most recently deleted text
.br
^V	 insert contents of window selection/paste buffer
.br
.LP
Mark operations:
.LP

esc-^U	 repeat next command four times
.br
esc-^U-\fIn\fP	 repeat next command \fIn\fP times
.br
.SH TOP-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT SEMANTICS
.LP
Upon startup, the \*(lqinteraction environment\*(rq used to
hold the top-level bindings for user-defined variables and other
identifiers contains an initial set of bindings, some standard
and some specific to \*s.
Any initial identifier binding may be replaced by redefining
the identifier with a normal top-level definition.
For example, the initial binding for \fIcons\fP can be replaced
with one that performs a "reverse cons" as follows.
.br
.sp
(define cons (lambda (x y) (import scheme) (cons y x)))
.br
.sp
Code entered into the REPL or loaded from a file prior to this
point will still use the original binding for \fIcons\fP.
If you want it to use the new binding, you must reenter or reload
the code.
Furthermore, the initial bindings for variables like \fIcons\fP are immutable,
so you cannot assign one (e.g., via set! or trace) without first defining
it.
This allows the system to check to make sure it receives the expected
two arguments at compile time and generate inline code to allocate
the pair.
This is not the case if \fIcons\fP is redefined, even if redefined to have
the same value, since its value can be changed via set! at any time
during a program run.
.SH COMMAND-LINE FILE ARGUMENTS
.LP
In the normal mode of operation,
the file names on the command line (except for the arguments
to the various command-line options) are
loaded before \*s begins interacting with the user.  Each of the
expressions in the loaded files is executed just as if it were
typed by the user in response to a prompt.  If you wish to load a
set of definitions each time, consider setting up a shell script to
load the file \*(lq.schemerc\*(rq from your home directory:
.br
.sp
     {InstallSchemeName} ${HOME}/.schemerc $*
.sp
.br
If you have a 
substantial number of definitions to load each time, it might
be worthwhile to compile the .schemerc file (that is, compile
the definitions and name the resulting object file .schemerc).
.LP
Typically, a Scheme programmer creates a source file of
definitions and other Scheme forms using an editor such as
\fIvi\fP(1) or \fIemacs\fP(1)
and loads the file into Scheme to test them.  The
conventional filename extension for \*s source files
is \fI.ss\fP.  Such a file may be loaded during a session by typing
(load \*(lq\fIfilename\fP\*(rq), or by specifying the filename on
the command line as mentioned above.  Any expression that may be
typed interactively may be placed in a file to be loaded.
.SH SCHEME SCRIPTS
.LP
When the \*(lq--script\*(rq option is used, the named file is
treated as a Scheme shell script, and the script name and remaining
command-line arguments are made available via the parameter
\*(lqcommand-line\*(rq.
To support executable shell scripts, the system ignores the first
line of a loaded script if it begins with #! followed by
a space or forward slash.
For example, the following script prints its command-line arguments.
.br
.sp
#! {InstallBin}/{InstallSchemeName} --script
.br
(for-each
.br
  (lambda (x) (display x) (newline))
.br
  (cdr (command-line)))
.SH RNRS TOP-LEVEL PROGRAMS
.LP
The \*(lq--program\*(rq option is like the \*(lq--script\*(rq option
except that the script file is treated as an RNRS top-level program.
The following RNRS top-level program prints its command-line arguments, as
with the script above.
.br
.sp
#! {InstallBin}/{InstallSchemeName} --program
.br
(import (rnrs))
.br
(for-each
.br
  (lambda (x) (display x) (newline))
.br
  (cdr (command-line)))
.LP
\*(lqscheme-script\*(rq may be used in place of \*(lqscheme --program\*(rq,
possibly prefixed by \*(lq/usr/bin/env\*(rq as suggested in the nonnormative
R6RS appendix on running top-level programs as scripts, i.e., the first line
of the top-level program may be replaced with the following.
.br
.sp
#! /usr/bin/env {InstallScriptName}
.br
.LP
If a top-level program depends on libraries other than those built into
\*s, the \*(lq--libdirs\*(rq option can be used to specify
which source and object directories to search.
Similarly, if a library upon which a top-level program depends has an
extension other than one of the standard extensions, the
\*(lq--libexts\*(rq option can be used to specify additional extensions
to search.
.LP
These options set the corresponding \*s parameters
library-directories and library-extensions.
The values of both parameters are lists of pairs of strings.
The first string in each library-directories pair identifies a
source-file root directory, and the second identifies the corresponding
object-file root directory.
Similarly, the first string in each library-extensions pair
identifies a source-file extension, and the second identifies the
corresponding object-file extension.
The full path of a library source or object file consists of the source or
object root followed by the components of the library name prefixed by
slashes, with the library extension added on the end.
For example, for root /usr/lib/scheme, library name
(app lib1), and extension .sls, the full path is
/usr/lib/scheme/app/lib1.sls.
.LP
The format of the arguments to \*(lq--libdirs\*(rq and
\*(lq--libexts\*(rq is the same:
a sequence of substrings separated by a single separator
character.
The separator character is a colon (:), except under Windows where it is a
semi-colon (;).
Between single separators, the source and object strings, if both are
specified, are separated by two separator characters.
If a single separator character appears at the end of the string,
the specified pairs are added to the existing list; otherwise, the
specified pairs replace the existing list.
The parameters are set after all boot files have been loaded.
.LP
If multiple \*(lq--libdirs\*(rq options appear, all but the final
one are ignored, and if 
If multiple \*(lq--libexts\*(rq options appear, all but the final
are ignored.
If no \*(lq--libdirs\*(rq option appears and the CHEZSCHEMELIBDIRS
environment variable is set, the string value of CHEZSCHEMELIBDIRS is
treated as if it were specified by a \*(lq--libdirs\*(rq option.
Similarly, if no \*(lq--libexts\*(rq option appears and the CHEZSCHEMELIBEXTS
environment variable is set, the string value of CHEZSCHEMELIBEXTS is
treated as if it were specified by a \*(lq--libexts\*(rq option.
.LP
The library-directories and library-extensions
parameters set by these options are consulted by the expander when it
encounters an import for a library that has not previously been defined or
loaded.
The expander first constructs a partial name from the list of components in the
library name, e.g., \*(lqa/b\*(rq for library (a b).
It then searches for the partial name in each pair
of root directories, in order, trying each of the source extensions then
each of the object extensions in turn before moving onto the next pair of
root directories.
If the partial name is an absolute pathname, e.g., \*(lq~/.myappinit\*(rq
for a library named (~/.myappinit), only the specified absolute
path is searched, first with each source extension, then with each object
extension.
If the expander finds both a source file and its corresponding object
file, and the object file is not older than the source file, the
expander loads the object file.
If the object file does not exist, if the object file is older, or
if after loading the object file, the expander determines it was
built using a library or include file that has changed, the source
file is loaded or compiled, depending on the value of the parameter
compile-imported-libraries.
If compile-imported-libraries
is set to #t, the expander
compiles the library via compile-library (which is described below).
Otherwise, the expander loads the source file.
(Loading the source file actually causes the code to be compiled,
assuming the default value of current-eval, but the compiled
code is not saved to an object file.)
An exception is raised during this process if a
source or object file exists but is not readable or if an object
file cannot be created.
.LP
The search process used by the expander when processing an import
for a library that has not yet been loaded can be monitored by
setting the parameter import-notify to #t.
This parameter can be set from the command line via the
\*(lq--import-notify\*(rq command-line option.
.SH OPTIMIZE LEVELS
The \*(lq--optimize-level\*(rq option sets the initial value of the
\*s optimize-level parameter to 0, 1, 2, or 3.
The value is 0 by default.
.LP
At optimize-levels 0, 1, and 2, code generated by the compiler is
\fIsafe\fP, i.e., generates full type and bounds checks.
At optimize-level 3, code generated by the compiler is \fIunsafe\fP,
i.e., may omit these checks.
Unsafe code is usually faster, but optimize-level 3 should be used only
for well-tested code since the absence of type and bounds checks may
result in invalid memory references, corruption of the Scheme heap (which
may cause seemingly unrelated problems later), system crashes, or other
undesirable behaviors.
.LP
At present, there is no direct difference other than safety among
optimize levels.
.SH COMPILING FILES
.LP
\*s compiles source expressions as it sees them.  In
order to speed loading of a large file, the file may be compiled
with the output placed in an object file.
(compile-file \*(lqfoo\*(rq) compiles the expressions in the file
\*(lqfoo.ss\*(rq and places the resulting object code on the file
\*(lqfoo.so\*(rq.  Loading a pre-compiled file is no different from
loading the source file, except that loading is faster since
compilation is already done.  
.LP
To compile a program to be run with --program, use
compile-program instead of compile-file.
compile-program preserves the first line unchanged, if it begins
with #! followed by a forward slash or space.
Also, while compile-file compresses the resulting object file,
compile-program does not do so if the #! line is present, so
it can be recognized by the shell's script executor.
Any libraries upon which the top-level program depends, other than
built-in libraries, must be compiled first via compile-file
or compile-library.
This can be done manually or by setting the parameter
compile-imported-libraries to #t before compiling the program.
.LP
To compile a script to be run with --script, use
compile-script instead of compile-file.
compile-script is like compile-program, but, like compile-file, implements
the interactive top-level semantics rather than the RNRS top-level
program semantics.
.SH BOOT and HEAP FILES
.LP
When \*s is run, it looks for one or more boot files to load.
Boot files contain the compiled Scheme code that implements most of
the Scheme system, including the interpreter, compiler, and most
libraries.
Boot files may be specified explicitly on the command
line via \*(lq-b\*(rq options or implicitly.
In the simplest case, no \*(lq-b\*(rq options
are given and the necessary boot files are loaded
automatically based on the name of the executable.
For example, if the executable name is \*(lqmyapp\*(rq, the
system looks for \*(lqmyapp.boot\*(rq in a set of standard
directories.
It also looks for and loads any subordinate boot files required
by \*(lqmyapp.boot\*(rq.
Subordinate boot files are also loaded automatically for the
first boot file explicitly specified via the command line.
When multiple boot files are specified via the command line and boot each
file must be listed before those that depend upon it.
.LP
The \*(lq--verbose\*(rq option may be used to trace the boot file
searching process and must appear before any boot arguments
for which search tracing is desired.
.LP
Ordinarily, the search for boot files is limited to a set of
default installation directories, but this may be overridden by setting
the environment variable SCHEMEHEAPDIRS.
SCHEMEHEAPDIRS should be a colon-separated list of directories, listed in
the order in which they should be searched.
Within each directory, the two-character escape sequence \*(lq%v\*(rq
is replaced by the current version, and the two-character escape sequence
\*(lq%m\*(rq is replaced by the machine type.
A percent followed by any other character is replaced by the second
character; in particular, \*(lq%%\*(rq is replaced by \*(lq%\*(rq, and
\*(lq%:\*(rq is replaced by \*(lq:\*(rq.
If SCHEMEHEAPDIRS ends in a non-escaped colon, the default directories are
searched after those in SCHEMEHEAPDIRS; otherwise, only those listed in
SCHEMEHEAPDIRS are searched.
Under Windows, semi-colons are used in place of colons.
.LP
Boot files consist of a header followed by ordinary compiled code and
may be created with make-boot-file.
For example,
.br
.sp
  (make-boot-file "myapp.boot" '("petite")
    "myapp1.so" "myapp2.so")
.sp
.br
creates a boot file containing the code from myapp1.so and myapp2.so
with a header identifying petite.boot as a boot file upon which the new
boot file depends.
Source files can be provided as well and are compiled on-the-fly
by make-boot-header.
.LP
Multiple alternatives for the boot file upon which the new boot
file depends can be listed, e.g.:
.br
.sp
  (make-boot-file "myapp.boot" '("petite" "scheme")
    "myapp1.so" "myapp2.so")
.sp
.br
When possible, both \*(lqscheme\*(lq and \*(lqpetite\*(lq should be
specified when creating a boot file for an application, as shown above, so
that the application can run in either \*p or \*s.
If the application requires the use of the compiler, just
\*(lqscheme\*(lq should be specified.
.LP
If the new boot file is to be a base boot file, i.e., one that does not
depend on another boot file, petite.boot (or some other boot file created
from petite.boot) should be listed first among the input files.

.SH DOCUMENTATION
.LP
Complete documentation for \*s is available in two parts:
\fIThe Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition\fP, and
\fIThe Chez Scheme Version 9 User's Guide\fP.
The first document is available in printed form from MIT Press,
and links to online versions of both documents are available
at https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/.
.LP
Several example Scheme programs, ranging from a simple factorial procedure
to a somewhat complex unification algorithm, are in the examples directory
(see FILES below).  Looking at and trying out example programs is a good way
to start learning Scheme.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.LP
The environment variable
.B SCHEMEHEAPDIRS \fR
(see above) may be set
to a colon-separated (semi-colon under Windows) list of directories
in which to search for boot files.
