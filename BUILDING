PREREQUISITES

On Unix variants:

 * Make [where GNU make is needed for some extra things, like docs]
 * GCC, Clang, or a similarly capable compiler
 * Header files and libraries for ncurses   [unless --disable-curses]
 * Header files and libraries for X windows [unless --disable-x11]

On Windows:

 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, 2019, 2017, or 2015


GETTING STARTED

This directory contains the sources for Chez Scheme. It may also
contain boot and header files in "boot/pb" for the "portable bytecode"
Chez Scheme machine type, which can be used to build for native
machine types, or you may have to create initial boot files using
an exsisting Chez Scheme build.

In you're on Windows, see the WINDOWS VIA COMMAND PROMPT section later
in this file. Otherwise, carry on to CONFIGURING AND BUILDING.


CONFIGURING AND BUILDING

Assuming you have boot files, building and installing is the usual
sequence:

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

This should not take more than a few minutes, after which the
commands `scheme` and `petite` can be used to run Chez Scheme and
Petite Chez Scheme, while `man scheme` and `man petite` can be used to
view the manual pages. Chez Scheme and Petite Chez Scheme are
terminal-based programs, not GUIs. They both incorporate sophisticated
command-line editing reminiscent of tcsh but with support for
expressions that span multiple lines.

Uninstalling on Unix-like systems is as simple as running:

  sudo make uninstall


WAYS TO GET BOOT FILES

1. If "boot/pb" is present, then it will normally be used
   automatically. You can perform the same step manually with

     ./configure --pb
     make <machine type>.bootquick

   to create boot files for <machine type>. You can use "auto"
   in place of <machine type> to build for an inferred machine
   type.

2. If you have an older version of Chez Scheme installed as `scheme`,
   then

     ./configure --force
     make re.boot

   creates boot files for an inferred <machine type>, or

     ./configure --force <machine type>
     make re.boot

   creates boot files for <machine type>. A `make` afterward builds
   for <machine type>. The `--force` flag disables the use of `pb`
   boot files, if present. You can supply `SCHEME=<scheme>` to run
   <scheme> instead of `scheme`.

   If your existing Chez Scheme installation is only slightly old, you
   may be able to create boot files more quickly using `cross.boot`
   instead of `re.boot`.

3. A combination of the previous two ways: If you plan to build on
   many different machines and you don't have pb boot files, then it
   may be a good idea to generate pb boot files once and then use them
   on different machines:

     ./configure --force --pb
     make re.boot

4. Along similar lines as the previous way, building for multiple
   specific <machine type>s: After you have a new Chez Scheme build
   for some machine, within that build you can use use

     make <machine type>.boot

   to quickly create boot files for any <machine type>.

5. If you have Racket installed as `racket`, then

     racket rktboot/main.rkt --machine <machine type>

   creates boot files for <machine type>.


DETAILS

The sources for Chez Scheme come in two parts:

 * A set of Scheme source files found in the subdirectory "s".
   Compiling these produces the boot files "petite.boot" and
   "scheme.boot", along with two header files, "equates.h" and
   "scheme.h".

 * A set of C source files found in the subdirectory "c". Compiling
   and linking these files produces the executable "scheme" (or
   "scheme.exe" on Windows). Compiling the C sources requires the two
   header files produced by compiling the Scheme sources.

The Scheme sources can be compiled only by a working version of Chez
Scheme or via Racket; it's not possible to build Chez Scheme from
source using only standard Unix tools, such as a C compiler, unless
the "pb" boot files are packaged with the source (which is a way of
including a working version of Chez Scheme).

The "configure" script attempts to determine what type of machine it's
on and looks for boot files for the machine in a "boot" subdirectory
(either in the same directory as the "configure" script or the current
directory is "configure" is run from elsewhere). If it find suitable
boot files, "configure" creates several files and directories in the
current directory (which does not have to be the same as the source
directory):

 * "Makefile" in the root (top level) directory.

 * "main.zuo" in the root (top level) directory.

 * A workarea as a subdirectory named for the machine type (e.g.,
   "ta6le" for threaded 64-bit linux). The workarea is a mirror of the
   root directory, with subdirectories named "c", "s", and so on.
   Compilation takes place in the workarea.

 * Within the workarea, the files "Mf-config" and "main.zuo".

The "configure" script recognizes various options for controlling the
type of build and the installation location. For example,
`--nothreads` requests a build without support for native threads,
`--32` requests a 32-bit build, and `--installprefix <pathname>`
specifies the installation root. Run `./configure --help` for
information on the supported options.

The generated makefile mostly just ensures that a `zuo` executable is
built in a `bin` directory, and then it defers the actual build work
to `zuo`, which uses the "main.zuo" file. If you have `zuo` installed,
you can use `zuo` directly instead of `make`. In general, instead of
the command `make X` to build target `X` as described below, you can
use `zuo . X` (or `bin/zuo . X` after `bin/zuo` is built).

The makefile supports several targets:

 * `make` or `make build`

   Compiles and links the C sources to produce the executable, then
   (except for cross builds) bootstraps the Scheme sources.

   Bootstrapping involves using the freshly built scheme executable
   along with initial boot files to compile the Scheme sources. If the
   new boot files are equivalent to the old boot files, the system is
   bootstrapped. Otherwise, the new boot files are used to create a
   newer set, and those are compared. If this succeeds, the system is
   bootstrapped. Otherwise, the make fails --- which should not
   happen, unless the initial boot files are incorrect or become out
   of sync with the sources.

   When you make a modification to the system that causes the C side
   to get out of sync with the Scheme side so that the build fails,
   the simplest approach is to re-bootstrap via `make re.boot`.

 * `make kernel`

   Compiles just the C sources to produce the executable so that
   running can use existing boot files.

 * `make run`

   Runs the build Chez Scheme without installing.

   Alternatively, you can run the executable directly and tell it
   where to find boot files, either by setting `SCHEMEHEAPDIRS` as

     env SCHEMEHEAPDIRS=<workarea>/boot/<machine type> \
         <workarea>/bin/<machine type>/scheme

   or through the `-B` command-line flag, which requires absolute
   paths:

     <workarea>/bin/<machine type>/scheme \
       -B <workarea>/boot/<machine type>/petite.boot \
       -B <workarea>/boot/<machine type>/scheme.boot

   Note that <workarea> and <machine type> are typically the same.

   If you use `zuo . run`, then additional arguments after `run` are
   passed along as arguments to `scheme`.

 * `sudo make install`

   Installs the built executables, boot files, example files, and
   manual pages. If the `--installprefix` used with "configure" is
   writable by the current user, then `sudo` is not necessary.

 * `sudo make uninstall`

   Uninstalls the executables, boot files, example files, and manual
   pages. As with `make install`, if the `--installprefix` used with
   "configure" is writable by the current user, then `sudo` is not
   necessary.

 * `make test`  (or `zuo . -j <jobs> test`)

   Runs the build plus runs a set of test programs in various
   different ways, e.g., with different compiler options. It can take
   on the order of an hour, depending on the speed of the machine.

   At the end of a complete run, a summary is shown. It should contain
   one line per test configuration, something like this:

     -------- o=0 --------
     -------- o=3 --------
     -------- o=0 cp0=t --------
     -------- o=3 cp0=t --------
     -------- o=0 spi=t p=t --------
     -------- o=3 spi=t p=t --------
     -------- o=0 eval=interpret --------
     -------- o=3 eval=interpret --------
     -------- o=0 cp0=t eval=interpret --------
     -------- o=3 cp0=t eval=interpret --------
     -------- o=0 ehc=t eoc=f --------
     -------- o=3 ehc=t eval=interpret --------

   If there is anything else in the output, something unexpected
   occurred. See "IMPLEMENTATION.md" for more information.

   To run test sets in parallel, use `zuo` instead of `make`, and
   supply the `-j` flag between `.` and `test`.

 * `make <machine type>.boot` or `make <machine type>.bootquick`

   Creates boot files for a supported machine type, which is not
   necessarily the current machine type. The boot files are written to
   a subdirectory in "boot".

   The difference between `boot` and `bootquick` is that the latter
   assumes that up-to-date boot files are in place for the current
   machine type, and it compile the cross compiler in unsafe mode. So,
   `bootquick` is faster, but `boot` is more helpful during
   development.

   Use "auto" for <machine type> as a shorthand for an inferred
   machine type after configuring with `--pb`.

   When using `zuo`, instead of encoding <machine type> in the target
   name, there are `boot` and bootquick` targets that take arguments.
   So, the corresponding commands as `zuo . boot <machine-type>` and
   `zuo . bootquick <machine-type>`.

 * `make cross.boot`

   Creates boot files for the configured machine type using an
   existing `scheme` executable, which must be sufficiently compatible
   version of Chez Scheme. (It doesn't need to be the same version,
   but it needs to have some compatible internal structure.) Supply
   `SCHEME=<scheme>` to select the Scheme implementaion.

   To use this target for a machine type whose boot files are not
   present (which would be typical for this target), run "configure"
   with the `--force` flag.

   When using `zuo`, use the `boot` target, but also supply
   `SCHEME=<scheme>` or `--host-scheme <scheme>`, or supply
   `--host-workarea <dir>` to use a Scheme built in existing workarea.
   In that last case, add `hostm=<machine type>` if the workarea's
   machine type does not match the machine type configured here.

 * `make re.boot`

   Like `make cross.boot`, but requires less compatibility from the
   existing Chez Scheme implementation, so it works with much older
   versions of Chez Scheme.

   When using `zuo`, use the `reboot` target with the same options as
   the `boot` target.

 * `make bootfiles`

   Runs the build plus uses the locally built system to recreate the
   boot and header files for multiple machine types --- each machine
   type for which a subdirectory exists in the top-level "boot"
   directory. To include a supported machine type that isn't already
   represented in "boot", simply add the appropriate subdirectory as
   empty or use `make <machine type>.boot` first.

 * `make docs`

   Runs the build plus generates HTML and PDF versions of the Chez
   Scheme Users Guide and the release notes. Unlike the other build
   targets, the documentation is not built in the workarea, but rather
   in the "csug" and "release_notes" directories (where "configure" is
   run).

   Building the documentation requires a few prerequisites not required
   to build the rest of Chez Scheme.  The following must be available
   in your PATH:

    * A TeX distribution (including latex, pdflatex, dvips, and gs)

    * ppmtogif and pnmcrop (from Netpbm)

   An X11 installation is not required, but ppmtogif does require an
   "rgb.txt" file, which it will automatically locate in the common
   X11 installation locations. If ppmtogif fails because it cannot
   find an "rgb.txt" file, you can use the `RGBDEF` environment
   variable to specify the path to a file. If your system has an Emacs
   installation, then you can find an "rgb.txt" file in the "etc"
   directory of the emacs installation. If your system has a Vim
   installation, then it might contain an "rgb.txt" in the directory
   identified by the `VIMRUNTIME` environment variable.

 * `make clean`

   Removes all built elements from the workarea, and then removes
   `bin/zuo`.


WINDOWS VIA COMMAND PROMPT

To build on Windows with MSYS2 and MinGW gcc or Clang, follow the same
instructions as for Unix above, but the result will be a native
Windows build. Cygwin as a compilation target is not currently
support.

To build on Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio, use

  build.bat <machine type>

where <machine type> is one of the following:

 * pb        (portable bytecode, usually for bootstrapping)
 * ta6nt     (64-bit Intel threaded
 * a6nt      (64-bit Intel non-threaded
 * tarm64nt  (64-bit Arm threaded)
 * arm64nt   (64-bit Arm non-threaded)
 * ti3nt     (32-bit threaded)
 * i3nt      (32-bit non-threaded)

If you're using Visual Studio 2022 or 2019, install "Desktop
development with C++" on the "Workloads" tabs and the "C++ 20[xx]
Redistributable MSMs" on the "Individual components" tab under the
"Compilers, build tools, and runtimes" section. If you have not yet
set up Microsoft Visual Studio command-line tools, `build.bat` will
run `c/vs.bat` to try to find and set up command-line tools
automatically for <machine type>.

The generated executables "scheme.exe" and "petite.exe" are in
"<machine type>\bin\<machine type>", and each relies on generated boot
files in "..\boot\<machine type>" relative to the executable. The
executables are dynamically linked against the Microsoft Visual C++
run-time library vcruntime140.dll. If you distribute the executables
to a different system, be sure to include the redistributable run-time
library.

The `build.bat` script creates and uses an `nmake`-compatible makefile
to build `zuo.exe` as its first step. You can use `zuo` to drive
targets described in DETAILS above, but you must explicitly set up
Microsoft Visual Studio command-line tools (perhaps using `c/vs.bat`).

By default, `build.bat` not only builds the "scheme.exe" executable,
it also builds DLLs and libraries to support four linking
combinations: Scheme as a DLL versus a static library, and using the C
runtime system as a DLL versus a statically linked C runtime library.

The `build.bat` script accepts some options that can be specified
after <machine type>:

 * `/none`

   Configures for a machine type, including creating the
   `nmake`-compable "Makefile", but does not build.

 * `/kernel`

   Builds just the "scheme.exe" executable without rebuilding boot
   files.

 * `/only`

   Builds just the "scheme.exe" executable and boot files, instead of
   also building DLLs and library variants.

 * '/dll'

   Specifies that "scheme.exe" should use the Scheme kernel compiled
   as a DLL "csv<vers>.dll", which normally should be included in the
   same directory as "scheme.exe". This is the default.

 * '/exe'

   Specifies that "scheme.exe" should statically link the Scheme
   kernel, instead of relying on a separate "csv<vers>.dll".

 * `/MD`

   Specifies that "scheme.exe" (and its DLL, if any) use the
   multi-threaded C runtime as a DLL. This is the default.

 * `/MT`

   Specifies that "scheme.exe" (and its DLL, if any) should statically
   link to the multi-threaded C runtime.

To create an installer you will need to use WSL or MSYS2 after
building with `build.bat`:

  cd wininstall
  make workareas
  make

These commands will create workareas and compile binaries for the
`a6nt`, `i3nt`, `ta6nt`, and `ti3nt` machine types and then include
them in a single Windows installer package "Chez Scheme.exe". The
package also includes example files and the redistributable Microsoft
Visual C++ run-time libraries.

When testing on Windows, the iconv tests in "mats/io.ms" require that
a 32-bit or 64-bit (as appropriate) "iconv.dll", "libiconv.dll", or
"libiconv-2.dll" implementing GNU libiconv be located alongside the
executable or via the `PATH` environment variable. Windows sources for
libiconv can be found at:

  http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libiconv.htm

An alternative implementation that uses the Windows API can be found
at:

  https://github.com/burgerrg/win-iconv/releases

If the DLL is not present, the iconv tests will fail.  No other tests
should be affected.

Unset the `TZ` environment variable before running the tests, because
the Cygwin values are incompatible with the Microsoft C Runtime
Library.

Use `zuo . test` described above to run the tests.


WINDOWS VIA CROSS-COMPILER

To cross-compile the main Chez Scheme executable for Windows using
MinGW, specify suitable build tools to configure, perhaps using
--toolprefix= like this:

 ./configure -m=ta6nt --toolprefix=x86_64-w64-mingw32- CC_FOR_BUILD=cc
 make kernel


EMSCRIPTEN

To target WebAssembly via Emscripten and `emcc`, use the
`--emscripten` flag:

 ./configure --emscripten

The default machine type is pb, but using the `--threads` and/or
`--pbarch` flags can adjust it to tpb, pb32l, or tpb32l. Boot files
for the machine type must be built already, and the configured
workarea is for building an executable and running output via node
with `make run`. The default workarea name is prefixed with "em-", so
output is written to "em-<machine type>/bin/"<machine type>",
including "scheme.js" and "scheme.html".

Boot files will be included in the result as preloads. Use
`--empetite` to omit the compiler as the "scheme.boot" boot file,
keeping only the runtime system as the "petite.boot" boot file.

To build Emscripten output that runs a specific program, compile the
program as a boot file that sets the `scheme-start` parameter, then
supply that boot file's path to `./configure` using the `--emboot=...`
flag. For example, suppose "demo.ss" contains the following:

 (define (go)
   (let loop ([i 10000000])
     (unless (zero? i)
       (loop (sub1 i)))))

 (scheme-start (lambda ()
                 (time (go))))

To compile this file, you'll need a build that runs on the current
machine for the target machine type, probably like this:

 ./configure --pb
 make
 make run

Using that build, create a boot file "demo.boot":

 (compile-file "demo.ss" "demo.so")
 (make-boot-file "demo.boot" (list "petite") "demo.so")

Finally, configure the Emscripten build to use "demo.boot":

 ./configure --pb --emscripten --emboot=demo.boot
 make


CROSS-COMPILING SCHEME PROGRAMS

Using

  make <machine type>.bootquick

or

  zuo . bootquick <machine type>

creates a "boot" subdirectory for <machine type> containing boot file,
and in the process create a cross-compilation patch file as
"xc-<machine type>/s/xpatch". Loading that "xpatch" file into Chez
Scheme for the current platform changes functions like `compile-file`
and `make-boot-file` to generate code for the target <machine type>.
