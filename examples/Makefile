# Unix make file to compile the examples.
# Compilation is not necessary since the examples may be loaded from
# source, but this gives an example of how to use make for Scheme.
# * To compile files not already compiled, type "make".  Only those
#   files in the object list below and not yet compiled will be compiled.
# * To compile all files, type "make all".  Only those files in the object
#   list below will be compiled.
# * To compile one file, say "fumble.ss", type "make fumble.so".  The
#   file need not be in the object list below.
# * To remove the object files, type "make clean".
# * To print the examples, type "make print".
