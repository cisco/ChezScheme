    release_notes/release_notes.stex csug/csug.stex
- added missing include
    killme.c
- added new mat verifying that primitives raise exceptions for invalid
  arguments based on primdata.ss signatures.  fixed some of those
  signatures, which weren't otherwise used except for arity checking.
  fixed some issues turned up by the test with who reports errors
  and how.
    primdata.ss, 5_1.ss, 7.ss, compile.ss, cpnanopass.ss, fasl.ss,
    interpret.ss, io.ss, record.ss, syntax.ss,
    primvars.ms, 5_1.ms, 7.ms, 8.ms, record.ms, mats/Mf-base,
    root-experr*, patch*
- string comparisons (string=?, string-ci<?, etc.) now get out fast
  when handed eq arguments.
    5_4.ss
- changed representation of most-negative iptr, I32, and I64 to make
  Visual C compiler happy.  updated windows make files, which had
  fallen out of date.  added missing hsrc= files sort.h and thread.h
  so they show up in the Windows workarea c directory.
    cmacros.ss,
    fasl.c, number.c, c/Mf-base, c/Makefile.{t,}{i3,a6}nt
- The scheme.h definition of Sfixnum(x) now uses multiply rather than
  left shift to avoid counting on the behavior of << on negative numbers,
  which is undefined in C.
    mkheader.ss
- Fixed a couple of casts, one harmless and the other causing
  Sinteger64_value to return 0 for the most-negative I64 on 32-bit
  builds.
    number.c
- The configure-generated Makefile distclean target no longer removes
  zlib and nanopass, since they are logically part of the git clone.
  It does run make distclean in zlib.
    makefiles/Makefile.in
- converted s_test_schlib shifts of -1 to equivalent shifts of 1 to
  avoid undefined left-shift behavior on negative numbers.
    prim5.c
- added if(---) {} wrapper around call to WRITE in display macro to
  silence unused return-value warnings.
    prim5.c
- liberalized get-mode check for ../mats.  it's not our business whether
  people make their directories group and/or other writeable.
    6.ms
- make test now prints the actual relative path to summary in the
  "check summary" message, whether invoked from the top-level directory
  or from the workarea.
    Makefile.in, Makefile-workarea.in
- configure now just uses cat to copy Makefile-workarea.in to $w/workarea,
  since the file is presently the same regardless of the configuration.
    configure
- fixed time-utc->date test in mat time&date-printing to work regardless of
  what locale (and time zone) the host machine has set.
    date.ms
- fixed date->time-utc to honor the zone-offset field when converting a date
  object to a time-utc object.
    stats.c,
    date.ms
- fixed incorrect handling of library-extension when searching wpo files
    compile.ss,
    7.ms
- modified floatify_normalize to properly round denormalized results.
  obviated scale_float in the process.
    number.c,
    ieee.ms
- fixed 0eNNNN for large NNNN to produce 0.0 rather than infinity
    strnum.ss,
    5_3.ms
- the reader now raises an exception with condition type implementation
  restriction (among the other usual lexical condition types), and
  string->number now raises #f, for #e<m>@<a>, where <m> and <a> are
  nonzero integers, since Chez Scheme can't represent polar numbers other
  than 0@<n> and <n>@0 exactly.  <m>@<a> still produces an inexact result,
  i.e., we're still extending the set of inexact numeric constants beyond
  what R6RS dictates.  doing this required a rework of $str->num, which
  turned into a fairly extensive rewrite that fixed up a few other minor
  issues (like r6rs:string->number improperly allowing 1/2e10) and
  eliminated the need for consumers to call $str->num twice in cases
  where it can actually produce a number.  added some related new tests,
  including several found missing by profiling.  added a couple of
  checks to number->string the absence of which was causing argument
  errors to be reported by other routines.
    strnum.ss, exceptions.ss, read.ss
    5_3.ms, 6.ms, root-experr*, patch*
- added pdtml flag, which if set to t causes profile-dump-html to be
  called at the end of a mat run.
    mats/Mf-base
- compile-whole-program and compile-whole-library now copy the hash-bang
  line from the wpo file (if it has one) to the object file.
    compile.ss,
    7.ms
- stex is now a submodule.  csug/Makefile and release_notes/Makefile
  set and use the required Scheme and STEXLIB variables accordingly.
  they default the machine type to a6le, but this can be overridden
  and is by the generated top-level Makefile.  the generated top-level
  Makefile now has a new docs target that runs make in both csug and
  release_notes, and an updated distclean target that cleans the same.
  the annoying csug Makefile .fig.pdf rule redefinition is now gone.
  copyright.stex and csug.stex now list May 2016 as the revision month
  and date; this will have to be updated for future releases.
    configure, makefiles/Makefile.in,
    csug/Makefile, copyright.stex, csug.stex,
    release_notes/Makefile
- added custom install options.  workarea creates an empty config.h,
  and configure creates a config.h that sets the default scheme heap
  path and scheme-script name based on the actual configuration.
    configure, newrelease, workarea, checkin,
    c/Mf-base, scheme.c, main.c,
    Mf-install.in
- renamed the installed example directory from lib to examples.
    Mf-install.in,
    scheme.1.in
- added force option to gzip during man page install to prevent gzip from
  asking for permission to overwrite existing man page files.
    Mf-install.in
- removed ~/lib/csv%v/%m from the default scheme heap path on unix-like
  systems.  documented inclusion of %x\..\..\boot\%m in the Windows
  default scheme heap path.
    main.c,
    use.stex
- added new configuration options: --installbin, --installlib,
  --installschemename, --installpetitename, and --installscriptname.
    configure
- updated the example library link to the nanopass framework.
    CONTRIBUTING.md
- now cleaning up petite.1 and scheme.1 left behind by make install
    Makefile-workarea.in, checkin
- now removing workarea after cleaning csug and release_notes so
  Mf-stex (included from csug/Makefile and release_notes/Makefile)
  doesn't complain trying to determine the machine type.
    Makefile.in
- added installsh support for --ifdiff so the csug make file can use it
  for the install target.
    installsh,
    csug/Makefile
- added instructions for building (cross-compiling) a boot file for
  a supported machine type for which a boot file is not built by default.
    BUILDING
- corrected CHEZSCHEMELIBS and CHEZSCHEMEEXTS index entries to be
  CHEZSCHEMELIBDIRS and CHEZSCHEMELIBEXTS.
    use.stex
- updated to curl stex version 1.2.1
    configure
- updated the fix to S_mktime to work on windows.  the struct tm
  structure on windows does not have the tm_gmtoff field used in the
  mac and linux version of the code.
    stats.c
- updated the Windows makefiles for building and testing to remove links for
  files that no longer exist, which was getting in the way of creating links
  for files that do exist.  Also updated the build batch file for Windows to
  compile the nanopass framework separately before building the rest of the
  scheme compiler and libraries.
    s/Mf-{a6,i3,ta6,ti3}nt, s/bldnt.bat,
    mats/Mf-{a6,i3,ta6,ti3}nt
- updated the read me to include a link to the Chez Scheme project page.
    README.md
- fixed embarrassing typo in read me.
    README.md
- profiler's html output refresh: mark the files as HTML5 rather
  than HTML4; use target attributes rather than onclick events to
  open links in specific windows; add a missing table row element;
  replace the deprecated name attribute with an id attribute (and
  replace the anchors with spans); and replace the deprecated valign
  attribute with a style attribute.

9.4.1 changes:
- updated version to 9.4.1
    bintar BUILDING NOTICE makefiles/Mf-install.in scheme.1.in

    mats/bldnt.bat workarea c/scheme.rc s/7.ss s/cmacros.ss
    release_notes/release_notes.stex csug/csug.stex
- updated newrelease to produce the correct log-entry format and
  fixed the existing 9.4.1 log entry
    newrelease, LOG
- replaced a couple of tabs
    number.c
- updated the descriptions of statistics and related functions to
  reflect the Version 9.3.1 change from sstats structures to sstats
  records, with sstats times represented as time objects and sstats
  bytes and counts represented as exact integers; also updated the
  sstats-difference description to reflect that it no longer coerces
  negative differences to zero.  added a corresponding release note.
    system.stex,
    release_notes.stex
- added a cast to eliminate a warning
    c/number.c
- fixed bug in Windows version of directory-separator-predicate when
  path-* procedures are passed a path that is not a string.
    s/6.ss
- fixed bug in cp0 on Windows with $foreign-wchar?.
    s/cp0.ss
- Cygwin is now used on Windows, updated mats, eliminated unused killme

    mats/patch-* mats/windows.ms s/Mf-*nt s/Mf-base workarea
    release_notes.stex
- fixed spelling of non-existent
    s/syntax.ss
- now forcing zlib configuration before compiling files that depend on
  the zlib header files, since zlib's configure script can modify the
  header files.  removed ZlibInclude variable, which no longer serves
  a purpose.
    c/Mf-*, c/Makefile.*nt
- removed unnecessary datestamp.c target
    c/Mf.*nt
- fixed unnessesary blocking in expeditor on Windows. 
    c/expeditor.c
- eliminated a couple of thread-safety issues and limitations on the
  sizes of pathnames produced by expansion of tilde (home-directory)
  prefixes by replacing S_pathname, S_pathname_impl, and S_homedir
  with S_malloc_pathname, which always mallocs space for the result.
  one thread-safety issue involved the use of static strings for expanded
  pathnames and affected various file-system operations.  the other
  affected the file open routines and involved use of the incoming
  pathname while deactivated.  the incoming pathname is sometimes if not
  always a pointer into a Scheme bytevector, which can be overwritten if a
  collection occurs while the thread is deactivated.  the size limitation
  corresponded to the use of the static strings, which were limited to
  PATH_MAX bytes.  (PATH_MAX typically isn't actually the maximum path
  length in contemporary operating systems.)  eliminated similar issues
  for wide pathnames under Windows by adding S_malloc_wide_pathname.
  consumers of the old routines have been modified to use the new
  routines and to free the result strings.  the various file operations
  now consistently treat a pathname with an unresolvable home directory
  as a pathname that happens to start with a tilde.  eliminated unused
  foreign-symbol binding of "(cs)pathname" to S_pathname.
    io.c, externs.h, new_io.c, prim5.c, scheme.c, prim.c
- various places where a call to close or gzclose was retried when
  the close operation was interrupted no longer do so, since this can
  cause problems when another thread has reallocated the same file
  descriptor.
    new_io.c
- now using vcvarsall type x86_amd64 rather than amd64 when the
  former appears to supported and the latter does not, as is the
  case with VS Express 2015.
    c/Mf-a6nt, c/Mf-ta6nt
- commented out one of the thread mats that consistently causes
  indefinite delays under Windows and OpenBSD due to starvation.
    thread.ms
- increased wait time for a couple of subprocess responses
    6.ms
- added call to collector to close files opened during iconv mats
  specifically for when mats are run under Windows with no iconv dll.
    io.ms
- fixed typo: VC/bin/vcvars64.bat => VC/bin/amd64/vcvars64.bat
    c/Mf-a6nt, c/Mf-ta6nt
- scheme_mutex_t now uses volatile keyword for owner and count fields
  because these fields can be accessed from multiple threads
  concurrently. Updated $yield and $thread-check in mats/thread.ms to
  be more tolerant of timing variability.
    c/types.h, mats/thread.ms, release_notes.stex
- fixed three instances of unchecked mallocs reported by laqrix in
  github issue #77.
    io.c, schlib.c, thread.c
- continue the profiler's html output refresh: refine the styling
  (and palette) and update CSUG to match. update the CSUG screenshots
  to reflect the refined look.

- add unicode support to the expression editor.  entry and display now work
  except that combining characters are not treated correctly for
  line-wrapping.  this addresses github issue #32 and part of issue #81.
    c/expeditor.c, s/expeditor.ss
- moved s_ee_write_char function within the WIN32 check to allow the unicode
  change to compile on windows.  unicode is not yet supported in the windows
  version of the repl.
    c/expeditor.c
- reworked the S_create_thread_object to print an error and exit when
  allocating the thread context fails from Sactivate_thread.  before
  this change, the error was raised on the main thread, which resulted
  in strange behavior at best.  also added who argument to
  S_create_thread_object to allow it to report either Sactivate_thread
  or fork-thread led to the error.
    externs.h, schsig.c, scheme.c, thread.c
- fixed a bug in cpvalid resulting in it leaving behind a cpvalid-defer
  form for later passes to choke on.  also fixed cp0 to print the correct
  name for cpvalid when it does this.
    cpvalid.ss, cp0.ss,
    misc.ms
- updated the prototype for s_ee_write_char to match the definition
    expeditor.c
- fixed a side-effect preservation bug with non-trivial test-context
  not-like patterns.
    cp0.ss,
    cp0.ms, 4.ms
- instead of default-exception handler, new-cafe establishes a handler
  that calls the current value of base-exception-handler so the handler
  can be overridden, as we do in our own make files.
    cafe.ss,
    7.ms
- fixed a bug in case and exclusive-cond syntax-error calls causing an
  exception in syntax-error instead of the intended error message.
    syntax.ss
- added tests for the case and exclusive-cond syntax-error calls
    4.ms, root-experr-compile-0-f-f-f
- added print-extended-identifiers parameter.  when #t, symbols like
  1+ and +++ print without escapes.
    priminfo.ss, print.ss,
    6.ms
- added descriptions of print-extended-identifiers to the user's guide
  and release notes.  updated the release notes to account for a couple
  of other log entries.
    release_notes.stex,
    intro.stex, io.stex
- updated the sockets example to work with the current version of Chez.
  Change the foreign procedure definitions to use the more portable int
  rather than integer-32.  Switch to a custom port
  [make-custom-binary-input/output-port] rather than a generic port
  [make-input/output-port], which resulted in deleting quite a bit of
  code.  Fix various compiler warnings in the C code, and along the way,
  fix a signedness bug in c_write that could have resulted in not writing
  the full buffer (but reporting that it did) in the case of errors from
  write.
    examples/csocket.c, examples/socket.ss
- use high-precision clock time on Windows 8 and up
    c/stats.c
- fixed profiling code that keyed profiling locations off of only the
  bfp to instead key off of both the bfp and efp.
    pdhtml.ss
- added Windows installer using the WiX Toolset
    BUILDING, install/* (new)
- fix typo in ordinal format for 12
    format.ss,
    format.ms
- renamed install directory to wininstall to avoid conflict with
  top-level Makefile
    BUILDING, install/* (removed), wininstall/* (new)
- updated zlib to version 1.2.11
    configure
- added procedure-arity-mask to report the allowed argument counts of
  a compiled function.  On a procedure from interpret or from one of
  the trace procedures or syntactic forms, procedure-arity-mask
  may report counts that are not actually allowed by the source
  procedure.

    prims.ss, strip.ss,
    fasl.c, gc.c, globals.h, prim.c, prim5.c, scheme.c, schsig.c,
    misc.ms, root-experr*,
    objects.stex
- for non-win32 systems, now setting al register to a count of the
  floating-point register arguments as required for varargs functions
  by the System V ABI.
    x86_64.ss,
    foreign.ms
- added a missing quote mark in new printf mat Windows case
    foreign.ms
- added travis-ci automation script and a 'partialx' testing target to
  allow us to perform more than a single run of testing without running
  afoul of travis-ci's 50-minute build timeout.  'partialx' tests six
  of the twelve configurations tested by 'allx'.
     .travis.yml (new),
     mats/Mf-base
- paired the 'partialx' down to just four test configurations, with one
  interpreter run, to try to get the threaded builds into line with
  travis-ci's timeout.
     mats/Mf-base
- eliminated some direct assumptions that a vector's type/length field
  is a fixnum and added meta-asserts to verify that it is in a couple of
  others, to facilitate future changes to vector typing.  vectors are
  now treated essentially like fxvectors, strings, and bytevectors.
    cmacros.ss, cpnanopass.ss, prims.ss, mkheader.ss,
    alloc.c, gc.c, scheme.c
- fixed a few comments to refer to scheme.c rather than main.c
    externs.h, globals.h, thread.c
- for 64-bit Windows systems, now copying foreign-procedure
  double-precision floating-point register arguments to integer
  registers as required for varargs functions. Windows does not
  support single-precision floating-point arguments as varargs.
    foreign.ms, np-languages.ss, x86_64.ss
- added an optional timeout argument to condition-wait
    externs.h, stats.c, thread.c, thread.h, csug/threads.stex,
    primvars.ms, thread.ms, release_notes.stex,
    date.ss, primdata.ss, prims.ss
- added immutable strings, vectors, fxvector, bytevectors, and boxes
    5_4.ss, 5_6.ss, bytevector.ss, cmacros.ss, cpnanopass.ss,
    fasl.ss, library.ss, mkheader.ss, primdata.ss, prims.ss,
    externs.h, types.h, alloc.c, fasl.c, gc.c, scheme.c,
    5_5.ms, 5_6.ms, bytevector.ms, misc.ms, root-experr*
    objects.stex
- various tweaks to the immutable object support; also taught cp0
  to simplify ($fxu< (most-positive-fixnum) e) => (fx< e 0) so we
  don't have any incentive in special casing length checks where
  the maximum length happens to be (most-positive-fixnum).
    5_4.ss, 5_6.ss, bytevector.ss, cmacros.ss, cp0.ss, cpnanopass.ss,
    mkheader.ss, primdata.ss, prims.ss,
    fasl.c, gc.c, types.h
    root-experr*, patch*
- generated bytevector=? procedure now gets out quickly on eq
  arguments.  cp0 optimizes away a number of additional equality
  operations at optimize-level 3 (including bytevector=?) when
  applied to the same variable references, as it already did for
  eq?, eqv?, and equal?, at all optimize levels.
    cpnanopass.ss, cp0.ss, primdata.ss,
    cp0.ms
- updated bullyx patches
    patch*
- updated release notes and tweaked user's guide.
    release-notes.stex, objects.stex
- fixed typo: fxvector-immutable-flag used in place of
  bytevector-immutable-flag in computation of type-immutable-bytevector
    cmacros.ss
- reallocated typed-object types, using previously unused tag #b010
  for strings and giving bytevectors both #b001 and #b101 (the
  latter for immutable bytevectors) so that the maximum bytevector
  length on 32-bit machines is once again the most-positive fixnum.
  treating bytevectors rather than strings or fxvectors (or even
  vectors) special in this regard is appropriate since the maximum
  number of bytes in a bytevector is maximum-length x 1 rather than
  maximum-length x 4 for strings, fxvectors, and vectors on 32-bit
  machines.  with this change on 32-bit machines, a vector can
  occupy up to 1/2 of virtual memory, strings and fxvectors 1/4,
  and bytevectors 1/8.
    cmacros.ss
- added record-type-equal-procedure, record-type-hash-procedure,
  record-equal-procedure, and record-hash-procedure to enable
  per-type customization of the behavior of equal? and equal-hash
  for a record value
     5_1.ss, newhash.ss, primdata.ss,
     record.ms, root-experr*,
     objects.stex
- adding dropped changes
    record.ss,
    root-experr*
- added entry for record-type-equal-procedure and friends
    release_notes.stex
- changed copyright year to 2017
    7.ss, scheme.1.in, comments of many files
- expanded the CSUG description of the handling of command-line
  arguments not recognized as standard options and added a description
  of the same to the COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS section of the man page.
  did a bit of minor cleanup elsewhere in the man page.
    use.stex, scheme.1.in
- destroy_thread now processes guardian entries
    thread.c, 4.ms, release_notes.stex
- mutexes and conditions are now freed when no longer used via
  $close-resurrected-mutexes&conditions, $keep-live primitive added
    externs.h, prim5.c, thread.c, 4.ms, thread.ms, release_notes.stex,
