    release_notes/release_notes.stex csug/csug.stex
- added missing include
    killme.c
- added new mat verifying that primitives raise exceptions for invalid
  arguments based on primdata.ss signatures.  fixed some of those
  signatures, which weren't otherwise used except for arity checking.
  fixed some issues turned up by the test with who reports errors
  and how.
    primdata.ss, 5_1.ss, 7.ss, compile.ss, cpnanopass.ss, fasl.ss,
    interpret.ss, io.ss, record.ss, syntax.ss,
    primvars.ms, 5_1.ms, 7.ms, 8.ms, record.ms, mats/Mf-base,
    root-experr*, patch*
- string comparisons (string=?, string-ci<?, etc.) now get out fast
  when handed eq arguments.
    5_4.ss
- changed representation of most-negative iptr, I32, and I64 to make
  Visual C compiler happy.  updated windows make files, which had
  fallen out of date.  added missing hsrc= files sort.h and thread.h
  so they show up in the Windows workarea c directory.
    cmacros.ss,
    fasl.c, number.c, c/Mf-base, c/Makefile.{t,}{i3,a6}nt
- The scheme.h definition of Sfixnum(x) now uses multiply rather than
  left shift to avoid counting on the behavior of << on negative numbers,
  which is undefined in C.
    mkheader.ss
- Fixed a couple of casts, one harmless and the other causing
  Sinteger64_value to return 0 for the most-negative I64 on 32-bit
  builds.
    number.c
- The configure-generated Makefile distclean target no longer removes
  zlib and nanopass, since they are logically part of the git clone.
  It does run make distclean in zlib.
    makefiles/Makefile.in
- converted s_test_schlib shifts of -1 to equivalent shifts of 1 to
  avoid undefined left-shift behavior on negative numbers.
    prim5.c
- added if(---) {} wrapper around call to WRITE in display macro to
  silence unused return-value warnings.
    prim5.c
- liberalized get-mode check for ../mats.  it's not our business whether
  people make their directories group and/or other writeable.
    6.ms
- make test now prints the actual relative path to summary in the
  "check summary" message, whether invoked from the top-level directory
  or from the workarea.
    Makefile.in, Makefile-workarea.in
- configure now just uses cat to copy Makefile-workarea.in to $w/workarea,
  since the file is presently the same regardless of the configuration.
    configure
- fixed time-utc->date test in mat time&date-printing to work regardless of
  what locale (and time zone) the host machine has set.
    date.ms
- fixed date->time-utc to honor the zone-offset field when converting a date
  object to a time-utc object.
    stats.c,
    date.ms
- fixed incorrect handling of library-extension when searching wpo files
    compile.ss,
    7.ms
- modified floatify_normalize to properly round denormalized results.
  obviated scale_float in the process.
    number.c,
    ieee.ms
- fixed 0eNNNN for large NNNN to produce 0.0 rather than infinity
    strnum.ss,
    5_3.ms
- the reader now raises an exception with condition type implementation
  restriction (among the other usual lexical condition types), and
  string->number now raises #f, for #e<m>@<a>, where <m> and <a> are
  nonzero integers, since Chez Scheme can't represent polar numbers other
  than 0@<n> and <n>@0 exactly.  <m>@<a> still produces an inexact result,
  i.e., we're still extending the set of inexact numeric constants beyond
  what R6RS dictates.  doing this required a rework of $str->num, which
  turned into a fairly extensive rewrite that fixed up a few other minor
  issues (like r6rs:string->number improperly allowing 1/2e10) and
  eliminated the need for consumers to call $str->num twice in cases
  where it can actually produce a number.  added some related new tests,
  including several found missing by profiling.  added a couple of
  checks to number->string the absence of which was causing argument
  errors to be reported by other routines.
    strnum.ss, exceptions.ss, read.ss
    5_3.ms, 6.ms, root-experr*, patch*
- added pdtml flag, which if set to t causes profile-dump-html to be
  called at the end of a mat run.
    mats/Mf-base
- compile-whole-program and compile-whole-library now copy the hash-bang
  line from the wpo file (if it has one) to the object file.
    compile.ss,
    7.ms
- stex is now a submodule.  csug/Makefile and release_notes/Makefile
  set and use the required Scheme and STEXLIB variables accordingly.
  they default the machine type to a6le, but this can be overridden
  and is by the generated top-level Makefile.  the generated top-level
  Makefile now has a new docs target that runs make in both csug and
  release_notes, and an updated distclean target that cleans the same.
  the annoying csug Makefile .fig.pdf rule redefinition is now gone.
  copyright.stex and csug.stex now list May 2016 as the revision month
  and date; this will have to be updated for future releases.
    configure, makefiles/Makefile.in,
    csug/Makefile, copyright.stex, csug.stex,
    release_notes/Makefile
- added custom install options.  workarea creates an empty config.h,
  and configure creates a config.h that sets the default scheme heap
  path and scheme-script name based on the actual configuration.
    configure, newrelease, workarea, checkin,
    c/Mf-base, scheme.c, main.c,
    Mf-install.in
- renamed the installed example directory from lib to examples.
    Mf-install.in,
    scheme.1.in
- added force option to gzip during man page install to prevent gzip from
  asking for permission to overwrite existing man page files.
    Mf-install.in
- removed ~/lib/csv%v/%m from the default scheme heap path on unix-like
  systems.  documented inclusion of %x\..\..\boot\%m in the Windows
  default scheme heap path.
    main.c,
    use.stex
- added new configuration options: --installbin, --installlib,
  --installschemename, --installpetitename, and --installscriptname.
    configure
- updated the example library link to the nanopass framework.
    CONTRIBUTING.md
- now cleaning up petite.1 and scheme.1 left behind by make install
    Makefile-workarea.in, checkin
- now removing workarea after cleaning csug and release_notes so
  Mf-stex (included from csug/Makefile and release_notes/Makefile)
  doesn't complain trying to determine the machine type.
    Makefile.in
- added installsh support for --ifdiff so the csug make file can use it
  for the install target.
    installsh,
    csug/Makefile
- added instructions for building (cross-compiling) a boot file for
  a supported machine type for which a boot file is not built by default.
    BUILDING
- corrected CHEZSCHEMELIBS and CHEZSCHEMEEXTS index entries to be
  CHEZSCHEMELIBDIRS and CHEZSCHEMELIBEXTS.
    use.stex
- updated to curl stex version 1.2.1
    configure
- updated the fix to S_mktime to work on windows.  the struct tm
  structure on windows does not have the tm_gmtoff field used in the
  mac and linux version of the code.
    stats.c
- updated the Windows makefiles for building and testing to remove links for
  files that no longer exist, which was getting in the way of creating links
  for files that do exist.  Also updated the build batch file for Windows to
  compile the nanopass framework separately before building the rest of the
  scheme compiler and libraries.
    s/Mf-{a6,i3,ta6,ti3}nt, s/bldnt.bat,
    mats/Mf-{a6,i3,ta6,ti3}nt
- updated the read me to include a link to the Chez Scheme project page.
    README.md
- fixed embarrassing typo in read me.
    README.md
- profiler's html output refresh: mark the files as HTML5 rather
  than HTML4; use target attributes rather than onclick events to
  open links in specific windows; add a missing table row element;
  replace the deprecated name attribute with an id attribute (and
  replace the anchors with spans); and replace the deprecated valign
  attribute with a style attribute.

9.4.1 changes:
- updated version to 9.4.1

    release_notes/release_notes.stex csug/csug.stex
- updated newrelease to produce the correct log-entry format and
  fixed the existing 9.4.1 log entry
    newrelease, LOG
- replaced a couple of tabs
    number.c
- updated the descriptions of statistics and related functions to
  reflect the Version 9.3.1 change from sstats structures to sstats
  records, with sstats times represented as time objects and sstats
  bytes and counts represented as exact integers; also updated the
  sstats-difference description to reflect that it no longer coerces
  negative differences to zero.  added a corresponding release note.
    system.stex,
    release_notes.stex
- added a cast to eliminate a warning
    c/number.c
- fixed bug in Windows version of directory-separator-predicate when
  path-* procedures are passed a path that is not a string.
    s/6.ss
- fixed bug in cp0 on Windows with $foreign-wchar?.
    s/cp0.ss
- Cygwin is now used on Windows, updated mats, eliminated unused killme

    mats/patch-* mats/windows.ms s/Mf-*nt s/Mf-base workarea
    release_notes.stex
- fixed spelling of non-existent
    s/syntax.ss
- now forcing zlib configuration before compiling files that depend on
  the zlib header files, since zlib's configure script can modify the
  header files.  removed ZlibInclude variable, which no longer serves
  a purpose.
    c/Mf-*, c/Makefile.*nt
- removed unnecessary datestamp.c target
    c/Mf.*nt
- fixed unnecessary blocking in expeditor on Windows.
    c/expeditor.c
- eliminated a couple of thread-safety issues and limitations on the
  sizes of pathnames produced by expansion of tilde (home-directory)
  prefixes by replacing S_pathname, S_pathname_impl, and S_homedir
  with S_malloc_pathname, which always mallocs space for the result.
  one thread-safety issue involved the use of static strings for expanded
  pathnames and affected various file-system operations.  the other
  affected the file open routines and involved use of the incoming
  pathname while deactivated.  the incoming pathname is sometimes if not
  always a pointer into a Scheme bytevector, which can be overwritten if a
  collection occurs while the thread is deactivated.  the size limitation
  corresponded to the use of the static strings, which were limited to
  PATH_MAX bytes.  (PATH_MAX typically isn't actually the maximum path
  length in contemporary operating systems.)  eliminated similar issues
  for wide pathnames under Windows by adding S_malloc_wide_pathname.
  consumers of the old routines have been modified to use the new
  routines and to free the result strings.  the various file operations
  now consistently treat a pathname with an unresolvable home directory
  as a pathname that happens to start with a tilde.  eliminated unused
  foreign-symbol binding of "(cs)pathname" to S_pathname.
    io.c, externs.h, new_io.c, prim5.c, scheme.c, prim.c
- various places where a call to close or gzclose was retried when
  the close operation was interrupted no longer do so, since this can
  cause problems when another thread has reallocated the same file
  descriptor.
    new_io.c
- now using vcvarsall type x86_amd64 rather than amd64 when the
  former appears to supported and the latter does not, as is the
  case with VS Express 2015.
    c/Mf-a6nt, c/Mf-ta6nt
- commented out one of the thread mats that consistently causes
  indefinite delays under Windows and OpenBSD due to starvation.
    thread.ms
- increased wait time for a couple of subprocess responses
    6.ms
- added call to collector to close files opened during iconv mats
  specifically for when mats are run under Windows with no iconv dll.
    io.ms
- fixed typo: VC/bin/vcvars64.bat => VC/bin/amd64/vcvars64.bat
    c/Mf-a6nt, c/Mf-ta6nt
- scheme_mutex_t now uses volatile keyword for owner and count fields
  because these fields can be accessed from multiple threads
  concurrently. Updated $yield and $thread-check in mats/thread.ms to
  be more tolerant of timing variability.
    c/types.h, mats/thread.ms, release_notes.stex
- fixed three instances of unchecked mallocs reported by laqrix in
  github issue #77.
    io.c, schlib.c, thread.c
- continue the profiler's html output refresh: refine the styling
  (and palette) and update CSUG to match. update the CSUG screenshots
  to reflect the refined look.

- add unicode support to the expression editor.  entry and display now work
  except that combining characters are not treated correctly for
  line-wrapping.  this addresses github issue #32 and part of issue #81.
    c/expeditor.c, s/expeditor.ss
- moved s_ee_write_char function within the WIN32 check to allow the unicode
  change to compile on windows.  unicode is not yet supported in the windows
  version of the repl.
    c/expeditor.c
- reworked the S_create_thread_object to print an error and exit when
  allocating the thread context fails from Sactivate_thread.  before
  this change, the error was raised on the main thread, which resulted
  in strange behavior at best.  also added who argument to
  S_create_thread_object to allow it to report either Sactivate_thread
  or fork-thread led to the error.
    externs.h, schsig.c, scheme.c, thread.c
- fixed a bug in cpvalid resulting in it leaving behind a cpvalid-defer
  form for later passes to choke on.  also fixed cp0 to print the correct
  name for cpvalid when it does this.
    cpvalid.ss, cp0.ss,
    misc.ms
- updated the prototype for s_ee_write_char to match the definition
    expeditor.c
- fixed a side-effect preservation bug with non-trivial test-context
  not-like patterns.
    cp0.ss,
    cp0.ms, 4.ms
- instead of default-exception handler, new-cafe establishes a handler
  that calls the current value of base-exception-handler so the handler
  can be overridden, as we do in our own make files.
    cafe.ss,
    7.ms
- fixed a bug in case and exclusive-cond syntax-error calls causing an
  exception in syntax-error instead of the intended error message.
    syntax.ss
- added tests for the case and exclusive-cond syntax-error calls
    4.ms, root-experr-compile-0-f-f-f
- added print-extended-identifiers parameter.  when #t, symbols like
  1+ and +++ print without escapes.
    priminfo.ss, print.ss,
    6.ms
- added descriptions of print-extended-identifiers to the user's guide
  and release notes.  updated the release notes to account for a couple
  of other log entries.
    release_notes.stex,
    intro.stex, io.stex
- updated the sockets example to work with the current version of Chez.
  Change the foreign procedure definitions to use the more portable int
  rather than integer-32.  Switch to a custom port
  [make-custom-binary-input/output-port] rather than a generic port
  [make-input/output-port], which resulted in deleting quite a bit of
  code.  Fix various compiler warnings in the C code, and along the way,
  fix a signedness bug in c_write that could have resulted in not writing
  the full buffer (but reporting that it did) in the case of errors from
  write.
    examples/csocket.c, examples/socket.ss
- use high-precision clock time on Windows 8 and up
    c/stats.c
- fixed profiling code that keyed profiling locations off of only the
  bfp to instead key off of both the bfp and efp.
    pdhtml.ss
- added Windows installer using the WiX Toolset
    BUILDING, install/* (new)
- fix typo in ordinal format for 12
    format.ss,
    format.ms
- renamed install directory to wininstall to avoid conflict with
  top-level Makefile
    BUILDING, install/* (removed), wininstall/* (new)
- updated zlib to version 1.2.11
    configure
- added procedure-arity-mask to report the allowed argument counts of
  a compiled function.  On a procedure from interpret or from one of
  the trace procedures or syntactic forms, procedure-arity-mask
  may report counts that are not actually allowed by the source
  procedure.
    cmacros.ss, compile.ss, cpnanopass.ss, mkheader.ss, primdata.ss,
    prims.ss, strip.ss,
    fasl.c, gc.c, globals.h, prim.c, prim5.c, scheme.c, schsig.c,
    misc.ms, root-experr*,
    objects.stex
- for non-win32 systems, now setting al register to a count of the
  floating-point register arguments as required for varargs functions
  by the System V ABI.
    x86_64.ss,
    foreign.ms
- added a missing quote mark in new printf mat Windows case
    foreign.ms
- added travis-ci automation script and a 'partialx' testing target to
  allow us to perform more than a single run of testing without running
  afoul of travis-ci's 50-minute build timeout.  'partialx' tests six
  of the twelve configurations tested by 'allx'.
     .travis.yml (new),
     mats/Mf-base
- paired the 'partialx' down to just four test configurations, with one
  interpreter run, to try to get the threaded builds into line with
  travis-ci's timeout.
     mats/Mf-base
- eliminated some direct assumptions that a vector's type/length field
  is a fixnum and added meta-asserts to verify that it is in a couple of
  others, to facilitate future changes to vector typing.  vectors are
  now treated essentially like fxvectors, strings, and bytevectors.
    cmacros.ss, cpnanopass.ss, prims.ss, mkheader.ss,
    alloc.c, gc.c, scheme.c
- fixed a few comments to refer to scheme.c rather than main.c
    externs.h, globals.h, thread.c
- for 64-bit Windows systems, now copying foreign-procedure
  double-precision floating-point register arguments to integer
  registers as required for varargs functions. Windows does not
  support single-precision floating-point arguments as varargs.
    foreign.ms, np-languages.ss, x86_64.ss
- added an optional timeout argument to condition-wait
    externs.h, stats.c, thread.c, thread.h, csug/threads.stex,
    primvars.ms, thread.ms, release_notes.stex,
    date.ss, primdata.ss, prims.ss
- added immutable strings, vectors, fxvector, bytevectors, and boxes
    5_4.ss, 5_6.ss, bytevector.ss, cmacros.ss, cpnanopass.ss,
    fasl.ss, library.ss, mkheader.ss, primdata.ss, prims.ss,
    externs.h, types.h, alloc.c, fasl.c, gc.c, scheme.c,
    5_5.ms, 5_6.ms, bytevector.ms, misc.ms, root-experr*
    objects.stex
- various tweaks to the immutable object support; also taught cp0
  to simplify ($fxu< (most-positive-fixnum) e) => (fx< e 0) so we
  don't have any incentive in special casing length checks where
  the maximum length happens to be (most-positive-fixnum).
    5_4.ss, 5_6.ss, bytevector.ss, cmacros.ss, cp0.ss, cpnanopass.ss,
    mkheader.ss, primdata.ss, prims.ss,
    fasl.c, gc.c, types.h
    root-experr*, patch*
- generated bytevector=? procedure now gets out quickly on eq
  arguments.  cp0 optimizes away a number of additional equality
  operations at optimize-level 3 (including bytevector=?) when
  applied to the same variable references, as it already did for
  eq?, eqv?, and equal?, at all optimize levels.
    cpnanopass.ss, cp0.ss, primdata.ss,
    cp0.ms
- updated bullyx patches
    patch*
- updated release notes and tweaked user's guide.
    release-notes.stex, objects.stex
- fixed typo: fxvector-immutable-flag used in place of
  bytevector-immutable-flag in computation of type-immutable-bytevector
    cmacros.ss
- reallocated typed-object types, using previously unused tag #b010
  for strings and giving bytevectors both #b001 and #b101 (the
  latter for immutable bytevectors) so that the maximum bytevector
  length on 32-bit machines is once again the most-positive fixnum.
  treating bytevectors rather than strings or fxvectors (or even
  vectors) special in this regard is appropriate since the maximum
  number of bytes in a bytevector is maximum-length x 1 rather than
  maximum-length x 4 for strings, fxvectors, and vectors on 32-bit
  machines.  with this change on 32-bit machines, a vector can
  occupy up to 1/2 of virtual memory, strings and fxvectors 1/4,
  and bytevectors 1/8.
    cmacros.ss
- added record-type-equal-procedure, record-type-hash-procedure,
  record-equal-procedure, and record-hash-procedure to enable
  per-type customization of the behavior of equal? and equal-hash
  for a record value
     5_1.ss, newhash.ss, primdata.ss,
     record.ms, root-experr*,
     objects.stex
- adding dropped changes
    record.ss,
    root-experr*
- added entry for record-type-equal-procedure and friends
    release_notes.stex
- changed copyright year to 2017
    7.ss, scheme.1.in, comments of many files
- expanded the CSUG description of the handling of command-line
  arguments not recognized as standard options and added a description
  of the same to the COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS section of the man page.
  did a bit of minor cleanup elsewhere in the man page.
    use.stex, scheme.1.in
- destroy_thread now processes guardian entries
    thread.c, 4.ms, release_notes.stex
- mutexes and conditions are now freed when no longer used via
  $close-resurrected-mutexes&conditions, $keep-live primitive added
    externs.h, prim5.c, thread.c, 4.ms, thread.ms, release_notes.stex,
    7.ss, cpnanopass.ss, np-languages.ss, primdata.ss, prims.ss
- fix reduction for map and for-each with optimization level 3
  to drop the expression, check that procedure has the correct
  arity and is discardable or unsafe.
  Also add a simplification for for-each with empty lists
  with optimization level 2.
    cp0.ss, 4.ms, primdata.ss
- fix invalid memory reference when enum-set-indexer procedure is not
  passed a symbol
    enum.ss, enum.ms, root-experr*, release_notes.stex
- fix overflow detection for fxsll, fxarithmetic-shift-left, and
  fxarithmetic-shift
    library.ss, fx.ms, release_notes.stex
- added ephemeron pairs and changed weak hashtables to use
  ephemeron pairs for key--value mapping to avoid the key-in-value
  problem
    prims.ss, primdata.ss, newhash.ss, fasl.ss, mkheader.ss
    cmacro.ss, prim5.c, fasl.c, gc.c, gcwrapper.c, types.h,
    4.ms, hash.ms, objects.stex, smgmt.stex, csug.bib
- check_dirty_ephemeron now puts ephemerons whose keys haven't yet
  been seen on the pending list rather than the trigger lists.
    gc.c
- removed scan of space_ephemeron from check_heap because check_heap
  as written can't handle the two link fields properly.
    gcwrapper.c
- in the ephemerons mat that checks interaction between mutation and
  collection, added generation arguments to the first two collect
  calls so they always collect into the intended generation.
    4.ms
- updated allx and bullyx patches
    patch*
- fix strip-fasl-file for immutable strings and vectors,
  fix an $oops call, and fix a vector-index increment in hashing
    strip.ss, 7.ss, newhash.ss, misc.ms
- fix signature of fxbit-set?
    primdata.ss
- more optimizations for map and for-each with explicit list
  extend the reductions for map and for-each when the arguments are
  explicit lists like (list 1 2 3 ...) or '(1 2 3 ...).
    cp0.ss,
    4.ms
- reverted to the preceding version of cp0 due to failure to preserve
  the expected evaluation order in one of the mats; removed the
  corresponding equivalent-expansion tests.
    cp0.ss,
    4.ms
- restored the map and for-each optimizations with a fix for the
  evaluation-order bug.
    cp0.ss,
    4.ms
- added date-dst? to access the previously-hidden DST information in
  date records, and added date-zone-name to provide a time zone name.
    date.ss, primdata.ss,
    stats.c,
    date.ms, root-experr*, patch-compile*,
    system.stex
- fixed a bug in flonum-extractor, which on 64-bit machines was using an
  8-byte read instead of a 4-byte read to pick up the 4 highest-order
  bytes of a little-endian flonum, potentially reading past the end of
  mapped memory for flonums produced by taking the imaginary part of an
  inexact complexnum (which, unlike other flonums, are not aligned on
  16-byte boundaries).  The 8-byte load would also have failed to produce
  correct results on 64-bit big-endian machines (of which we presently
  have none) because the offsets passed to flonum-extractor assume the
  bits are in the lowest-order 4 bytes of the extracted field.
    cp0.ss,
    misc.ms,
    release_notes.stex
- support Windows build on Bash/WSL
    BUILDING, configure, workarea, c/vs.bat (new), mats/vs.bat (new),
    c/Mf-*nt, mats/Mf-*, s/Mf-base
- fix c/version.h for FreeBDS (machine types i3fb, ti3fb, a6fb, ta6fb)
- fix reference to libc.so to be libc.so.7 for FreeBSD (machine types
  i3fb, ti3fb, a6fb, ta6fb)
    foreign.ms
- added CC option to configure for selecting the compiler
    configure,
    c/Mf-*
- Suppress warnings from implicit fallthrough in case labels.

- the $case macro used by r6rs:case and case now unconditionally trims
  redundant keys and expands into exclusive-cond rather than cond.
  it catches references to => before expanding into exclusive-cond
  to avoid supporting => as an undocumented and useless extension
  of the case syntax.  the r6rs:case and case macros now require
  multiple clauses rather than leaving the enforcement to exclusive-cond,
  and the exclusive-cond macro now requires multiple clauses rather
  than leaving the enforcement to cond.

  locale.h includes xlocale.h or, in glibc 2.26, its replacement.
    expeditor.c

  month and year at the time of generation.
    csug.stex, copyright.stex

- added pass-time tracking for pre-cpnanopass passes to compile.
    compile.ss
- added inline handler for fxdiv-and-mod
    cp0.ss, primdata.ss
- changed order in which return-point operations are done (adjust
  sfp first, then store return values, then restore local saves) to
  avoid storing return values to homes beyond the end of the stack
  in cases where adjusting sfp might result in a call to dooverflood.
    cpnanopass.ss, np-languages.ss
- removed unused {make-,}asm-return-registers bindings
    cpnanopass.ss
- corrected the max-fv value field of the lambda produced by the
  hand-coded bytevector=? handler.
    cpnanopass.ss
- reduced live-pointer and inspector free-variable mask computation
  overhead
    cpnanopass.ss
- moved regvec cset copies to driver so they aren't copied each
  time a uvar is assigned to a register.  removed checks for
  missing register csets, since registers always have csets.
    cpnanopass.ss
- added closure-rep else clause in record-inspector-information!.
    cpnanopass.ss
- augmented tree representation with a constant representation
  for full trees to reduce the overhead of manipulating trees or
  subtress with all bits set.
    cpnanopass.ss
- tree-for-each now takes start and end offsets; this cuts the
  cost of traversing and applying the action when the range of
  applicable offsets is other than 0..tree-size.
    cpnanopass.ss
- introduced the notion of poison variables to reduce the cost of
  register/frame allocation for procedures with large sets of local
  variables.  When the number of local variables exceeds a given
  limit (currently hardwired to 1000), each variable with a large
  live range is considered poison.  A reasonable set of variables
  with large live ranges (the set of poison variables) is computed
  by successive approximation to avoid excessive overhead.  Poison
  variables directly conflict with all spillables, and all non-poison
  spillables indirectly conflict with all poison spillables through
  a shared poison-cset.  Thus poison variables cannot live in the
  same location as any other variable, i.e., they poison the location.
  Conflicts between frame locations and poison variables are handled
  normally, which allows poison variables to be assigned to
  move-related frame homes.  Poison variables are spilled prior to
  register allocation, so conflicts between registers and poison
  variables are not represented.  move relations between poison
  variables and frame variables are recorded as usual, but other
  move relations involving poison variables are not recorded.
    cpnanopass.ss, np-languages.ss
- changed the way a uvar's degree is decremented by remove-victim!.
  instead of checking for a conflict between each pair of victim
  and keeper and decrementing when the conflict is found, remove-victim!
  now decrements the degree of each var in each victim's conflict
  set.  while this might decrement other victims' degrees unnecessarily,
  it can be much less expensive when large numbers of variables are
  involved, since the number of conflicts between two non-poison
  variables should be small due to the selection process for
  (non-)poison variables and the fact that the unspillables introduced
  by instruction selection should also have few conflicts.  That
  is, it reduces the worst-case complexity of decrementing degrees
  from O(n^2) to O(n).
    cpnanopass.ss
- took advice in compute-degree! comment to increment the uvars in
  each registers csets rather than looping over the registers for
  each uvar asking whether the register conflicts with the uvar.
    cpnanopass.ss
- assign-new-frame! now zeros out save-weight for local saves, since
  once they are explicitly saved and restored, they are no longer
  call-live and thus have no save cost.

- updated newrelease to handle mats/Mf-*nt
    newrelease mats/Mf-a6nt mats/Mf-i3nt mats/Mf-ta6nt mats/Mf-ti3nt
- fixed gather-filedata's sort of profile entries.  for any two
  entries x and y in the list produced by the sort call, if x's
  bfp = y's bfp, x should come before y if x's efp < y's efp.
  The idea is that enclosing entries should always come later
  in the list.  this affects only languages where two expressions
  can start at the same character position.
    pdhtml.ss
- expanded capability of ez-grammar with support for simpl
  parsing of binary operators w/precedence and associativity
  and automatically generated markdown grammar descriptions.
  ez-grammar-test.ss now also doubles as a test of pdhtml for
  algebraic languages.
    mats/examples.ms,
    examples/ez-grammar.ss, examples/ez-grammar-test.ss,
    examples/Makefile
- maybe-compile-{file,program,library} and automatic import
  compilation now treat a malformed object file as if it were
  not present and needs to be regenerated.  A malformed object
  file (particularly a truncated one) might occur if the compiling
  processes is killed or aborts before it has a chance to delete
  a partial object file.

- more staid and consistent Mf-cross main target
    Mf-cross
- cpletrec now replaces the incoming prelexes with new ones so
  that it doesn't have to alter the flags on the incoming ones, since
  the same expander output is passed through the compiler twice while
  compiling a file with macro definitions or libraries.  we were
  getting away without this just by luck.
    cpletrec.ss
- pure? and ivory? now return #t for a primref only if the prim is
  declared to be a proc, since some non-proc prims are mutable, e.g.,
  $active-threads and $collect-request-pending.
    cp0.ss
- $error-handling-mode? and $eol-style? are now properly declared to
  be procs rather than system state variables.
    primdata.ss
- the new pass $check-prelex-flags verifies that prelex referenced,
  multiply-referenced, and assigned flags are set when they
  should be.  (it doesn't, however, complain if a flag is set
  when it need not be.)  when the new system parameter
  $enable-check-prelex-flags is set, $check-prelex-flags is
  called after each major pass that produces Lsrc forms to verify
  that the flags are set correctly in the output of the pass.
  this parameter is unset by default but set when running the
  mats.
    cprep.ss, back.ss, compile.ss, primdata.ss,
    mats/Mf-base
- removed the unnecessary set of prelex referenced flag from the
  build-ref routines when we've just established that it is set.
    syntax.ss, compile.ss
- equivalent-expansion? now prints differences to the current output
  port to aid in debugging.
    mat.ss
- the nanopass that patches calls to library globals into calls to
  their local counterparts during whole-program optimization now
  creates new prelexes and sets the prelex referenced, multiply
  referenced, and assigned flags on the new prelexes rather than
  destructively setting flags on the incoming prelexes.  The
  only known problems this fixes are (1) the multiply referenced
  flag was not previously being set for cross-library calls when
  it should have been, resulting in overly aggressive inlining
  of library exports during whole-program optimization, and (2)
  the referenced flag could sometimes be set for library exports
  that aren't actually used in the final program, which could
  prevent some unreachable code from being eliminated.
    compile.ss
- added support for specifying default record-equal and
  record-hash procedures.
    primdata.ss, cmacros.ss, cpnanopass.ss, prims.ss, newhash.ss,
    gc.c,
    record.ms
- added missing call to relocate for subset-mode tc field, which
  wasn't burning us because the only valid non-false value, the
  symbol system, is in the static generation after the initial heap
  compaction.
    gc.c
- added a lambda-commonization pass that runs after the other
  source optimizations, particularly inlining, and a new parameter
  that controls how hard it works.  the value of commonization-level
  ranges from 0 through 9, with 0 disabling commonization and 9
  maximizing it.  The default value is 0 (disabled).  At present,
  for non-zero level n, the commonizer attempts to commonize
  lambda expressions consisting of 2^(10-n) or more nodes.
  commonization of one or more lambda expressions requires that
  they have identical structure down to the leaf nodes for quote
  expressions, references to unassigned variables, and primitives.
  So that various downstream optimizations aren't disabled, there
  are some additional restrictions, the most important of which
  being that call-position expressions must be identical.  The
  commonizer works by abstracting the code into a helper that
  takes the values of the differing leaf nodes as arguments.
  the name of the helper is formed by concatenating the names of
  the original procedures, separated by '&', and this is the name
  that will show up in a stack trace.  The source location will
  be that of one of the original procedures.  Profiling inhibits
  commonization, because commonization requires profile source
  locations to be identical.
    cpcommonize.ss (new), compile.ss, interpret.ss, cprep.ss,
    primdata.ss, s/Mf-base,
    mats/Mf-base
- cpletrec now always produces a letrec rather than a let for
  single immutable lambda bindings, even when not recursive, for
  consistent expand/optimize output whether the commonizer is
  run or not.
    cpletrec.ss,
    record.ms
- trans-make-ftype-pointer no longer generates a call to
  $verify-ftype-address if the address expression is a call to
  ftype-pointer-address.

  so the reduced version checks that p is a procedure.
  Also make the same change for #2%for-each.

    prim.c, 7.ss, primdata.ss, 7.ms, smgmt.stex, release_notes.stex
- added identifier? checks to detect attempts to use non-identifier
  field names in define-record-type field specs.
    syntax.ss,
    record.ms, root-experr*
- fixed an issue with the library system where an exception that occurs
  during visit or revisit left the library in an inconsistent state that
  caused it to appear that it was still in the process of running.  This
  manifested in it raising a cyclic dependency exception, even though
  there really is not a cyclic dependency.  The various library
  management functions involved will now reset the part of the library
  when an exception occurs.  This also means that if the library visit
  or revisit failed for a transient reason (such as a missing or
  incorrect library version that can be fixed by updating the
  library-directories) it is now possible to recover from these errors.
    expand-lang.ss, syntax.ss, interpret.ss, compile.ss, cprep.ss,

    BUILDING, c/Mf-*le, stats.c, objects.stex, release_notes.stex
- when thread_get_room exhausts the local allocation area, it now
  goes through a common path with S_get_more_room to allocate a new
  local allocation area when appropriate.  this can greatly reduce
  the use of global allocation (and the number of tc mutex acquires
  in threaded builds) when a lot of small objects are allocated by
  C code with no intervening Scheme-side allocation or dirty writes.

- clarified required use of scheme-start to start an application
  packaged as a boot file and added a short "myecho" example.
    use.stex
- fixed a bug in cp0 bug that could fold the apply of a primitive, where
  the last argument is not a list, as if it were a call to the primitive
  with those arguments
    cp0.ss, cp0.ms
- fix allocation of string/bytevector for a foreign-callable argument
  or foreign-call return
    cpnanopass.ss, foreign.ms, foreign2.c
- foreign-callable code objects are now flagged as "templates", and
  the collector now refuses to discard relocation information for
  code objects marked as templates when copying them to the static
  generation.
    cmacros.ss, cpnanopass.ss,
    gc.c,

    newhash.ss, primdata.ss,
    hash.ms, root-experr*, patch*,
    objects.stex, release_notes.stex
- the body of load-library is now wrapped in a $pass-time with
  to show the time spent loading libraries separately from the time
  spent in expand.
    syntax.ss
- interpret now plays the pass-time game
    interpret.ss

  compile-time-value-value accessor
    syntax.ss, primdata.ss,
    8.ms, primvars.ms, root-experr*
- $pass-stats now returns accurrate stats for the currently timed
  pass.
    7.ss
- compile-whole-program and compile-whole-library now propagate
  recompile info from the named wpo file to the object file 
  to support maybe-compile-program and maybe-compile-library in
  the case where compile-whole-{program,library} overwrites the
  original object file.
    compile.ss,
    7.ms, mat.ss, primvars.ms
- replaced the ancient and unusable bintar with one that creates
  a useful tarball for binary installs
    bintar
- generated Mf-install InstallBin (InstallLib, InstallMan) now
  correctly indirects through InstallPrefix if the --installbin
  (--installlib, --installman) configure flag is not present.
    configure
- removed definition of generate-procedure-source-information
    patch.ss
- guardian tconc cells are now allocated in generation 0 in the hope
  that they can be released more quickly.
    gc.c
- added ftype-guardian syntax: (ftype-guardian A) creates a new
  guardian for ftype pointers of type A, the first base field (or
  one of the first base fields in the case of unions) of which must
  be a word-sized integer with native endianness representing a
  reference count.  ftype pointers are registered with and retrieved
  from the guardian just like objects are registered with and
  retrieved from any guardian.  the difference is that the garbage
  collector decrements the reference count before resurrecting an
  ftype pointer and resurrects only those whose reference counts
  become zero, i.e., are ready for deallocation.

- fixed a bug in automatic recompilation handling of missing include
  files specified with absolute pathnames or pathnames starting with
  "./" or "..": was erroring out in file-modification-time with a
  file-not-found or other exception rather than recompiling.
    syntax.ss,
    7.ms, root-experr*, patch*
- changed inline vector-for-each and string-for-each code to
  put the last call to the procedure in tail position, as was
  already done for the library definitions and for the inline
  code for for-each.
    cp0.ss,
    5_4.ms, 5_6.ms
- the compiler now generates better inline code for the bytevector
  procedure.  instead of one byte memory write for each argument,
  it writes up to 4 (32-bit machines) or 8 (64-bit machines) bytes
  at a time, which almost always results in fewer instructions and
  fewer writes.
    cpnanopass.ss,
    bytevector.ms
- packaged unchanging implicit reader arguments into a single record
  to reduce the number of arguments.
    read.ss
- recoded run-vector to handle zero-length vectors.  it appears
  we're not presently generating empty vectors (representing empty
  groups), but the fasl format permits them.
    7.ss
- reverted the earlier change to restore indirection through
  InstallPrefix, since it didn't and can't play well with the
  generated config.h.  Instead removed InstallPrefix entirely so
  it isn't an attractive hazzard.
    configure, makefiles/Mf-install.in
- fixed bug in inline-lists: wasn't setting multiply-referenced flag
  on p to account for the procedure? check at optimize-level 2.
    cpletrec.ss
- fixed bug in check-prelex-flags: was hardwiring $cpcheck-prelex-flags
  "after" argument to 'uncprep rather than passing along its argument.
    compile.ss
- commented out local definition of sorry! so that problems detected
  by $cpcheck-prelex-flags actually result in a raised exception.
    cprep.ss
- exposed the default-library-search-handler and a library-search-handler
  parameter to permit more control over the search for libraries during
  import, compile-whole-library, and compile-whole-program
    syntax.ss, primdata.ss,
    8.ms,
    libraries.stex
- added fix for whole program/library compilation bug with help from
  @owaddell who originally reported the problem in issue 386.  this bug
  arises from the way the parts of the combined library, and their
  binary dependencies, are invoked when one of the constituent libraries
  is invoked.  consider, for example, a combined library that contains
  (A) and (B), where (B) depends on a binary library (C).  depending on
  the sort order of (A) and (B), which may be unconstrained in the
  partial ordering established by library dependencies, invoking (A) may
  result in the invoke code for (B) being run first, without (B) ever
  being explicitly invoked.  this can result in bindings required from
  (C) by the invoke code in (B) to be unbound.  even in the case where
  (A) comes before (B) in the topological sort, if they are combined
  into the same cluster, (B)'s invoke code will be run as part of
  invoking (A).  the solution is two part: first we extend the invoke
  requirements of the first library in the cluster to include the binary
  libraries that precede it in the topological sort and add a dependency
  on the first library in the cluster to all of the other libraries in
  the cluster.  this means no matter which library in the cluster is
  invoked first, it will cause the first library to be invoked, in turn
  ensuring the binary libraries that precede it are invoked.  when there
  are multiple clusters, a dependency is added from each cluster to the
  first library in the cluster that precedes it.  this ensures that
  invoking a library in a later cluster first, will still cause all of
  the dependencies of the previous clusters to be invoked.  ultimately,
  these extra dependencies enforce an ordering on the invocation of the
  source and binary libraries that matches the topological sort, even if
  the topological sort was under constrained.  to maintain the property
  that import requirements are a superset of the invoke and visit
  requirements, we also extend the import requirements to include the
  extended invoke requirements.  the import requirements are also added
  to the dependency graph to further constrain the topological sort and
  ensure that we do not introduce artificial cycles in the import graph.
    compile.ss,
    7.ms,
    root-experr*, patch*
- fixed failure to install examples for tarball installs
    Mf-install.in
- improved packaging support:
  replaced bintar script with bintar directory and make file;
  tarballs are created via "make create-tarball" and are placed in
  the workarea's bintar directory.  added rpm directory and make
  file for creating RPMs via "make create-rpm".  added pkg directory
  and make file for creating OSX packages via "make create-pkg".
    bintar (removed), bintar/Makefile (new), rpm/Makefile (new),
    pkg/Makefile (new), pkg/rmpkg (new), workarea, checkin, newrelease,
    Makefile.in, Makefile-workarea.in.
- improved error message for compile-whole-program and
  compile-whole-library when a top-level expression is discovered while
  processing a wpo file.
    compile.ss
- minor build and new-release updates
    checkin, newrelease, Makefile.in, Makefile-workarea.in
- added library-search-handler, compile-whole-library, and improved
  packaging to the release notes.

- fixed a bug in the fasl representation and reading of mutually
  recursive ftypes where one of the members of the cycle is the
  parent of another, which manifested in the fasl reader raising
  bogus "incompatible record type" exceptions.  (The bug could also
  affect other record-type descriptors with cycles involving parent
  rtds and "extra" fields.)  object files created before this fix
  are incompatible with builds with this fix, and objects files
  created after this fix are incompatible builds without this fix.

- added compress-level parameter to select a compression level for
  file writing and changed the default for lz4 compression to do a
  better job compressing.  finished splitting glz input routines
  apart from glz output routines and did a bit of other restructuring.
  removed gzxfile struct-as-bytevector wrapper and moved its fd
  into glzFile.  moved DEACTIVATE to before glzdopen_input calls
  in S_new_open_input_fd and S_compress_input_fd, since glzdopen_input
  reads from the file and could block.  the compress format and now
  level are now recorded directly the thread context.  replaced
  as-gz? flag bit in compressed bytevector header word with a small
  number of bits recording the compression format at the bottom of
  the header word.  flushed a couple of bytevector compression mats
  that depended on the old representation.  (these last few changes
  should make adding new compression formats easier.)  added
  s-directory build options to choose whether to compress and, if
  so, the format and level.

- improved the effectiveness of LZ4 boot-file compression to within
  15% of gzip by increasing the lz4 output-port in_buffer size to
  1<<18.  With the previous size (1<<14) LZ4-compressed boot files
  were about 50% larger.  set the lz4 input-port in_buffer and
  out_buffer sizes to 1<<12 and 1<<14.  there's no clear win at
  present for larger input-port buffer sizes.
    compress-io.c
- To reduce the memory hit for the increased output-port in_buffer
  size and the corresponding increase in computed out_buffer size,
  one output-side out_buffer is now allocated (lazily) per thread
  and stored in the thread context.  The other buffers are now
  directly a part of the lz4File_out and lz4File_in structures
  rather than allocated separately.
    compress-io.c, scheme.c, gc.c,
    cmacros.ss
- split out the buffer emit code from glzwrite_lz4 into a
  separate glzemit_lz4 helper that is now also used by gzclose
  so we can avoid dealing with a NULL buffer in glzwrite_lz4.
  glzwrite_lz4 also uses it to writing large buffers directly and
  avoid the memcpy.
    compress-io.c
- replaced lz4File_out and lz4File_in mode enumeration with the
  compress format and inputp boolean.  using switch to check and
  raising exceptions for unexpected values to further simplify
  adding new compression formats in the future.
    compress-io.c
- replaced the never-defined struct lz4File pointer in glzFile
  union with the more specific struct lz4File_in_r and Lz4File_out_r
  pointers.
    compress-io.h, compress-io.c
- added free of lz4 structures to gzclose.  also changed file-close
  logic generally so that (1) port is marked closed before anything is
  freed to avoid dangling pointers in the case of an interrupt or
  error, and (2) structures are freed even in the case of a write
  or close error, before the error is reported.  also now mallocing
  glz and lz4 structures after possibility of errors have passed where
  possible and freeing them when not.
    compress-io.c,
    io.ss
- added return-value checks to malloc calls and to a couple of other
  C-library calls.
    compress-io.c
- corrected EINTR checks to look at errno rather than return codes.
    compress-io.c

    externs.h, compress-io.c, new-io.c, scheme.c, fasl.c
- added entries for mutex-name and mutex-thread
    threads.stex
- fix record-ref reduction in cp0
  in expressions like
    (record-ref ... (begin (newline) (record ...)))
  the reduction was dropping the possible side effect expressions
  in this case the (newline).
    cp0.ss
- zero?, fxzero?, positive?, fxpositive?, etc., now go through
  (a suitably modified) relop-length so that, for example,
  (zero? (length x)) results in the same code as (null? x).  added
  correctness tests for these and all of the other predicates that
  go through relop-length.
    cpnanopass.ss, 5_2.ms

  irritants in the original call when who or message is found not to
  be of the right type.

- annotations are now preserved in object files for debug
  only, for profiling only, for both, or not at all, depending
  on the settings of generate-inspector-information and
  compile-profile.  in particular, when inspector information
  is not enabled but profiling is, source information does
  not leak into error messages and inspector output, though it is
  still available via the profile tools.  The mechanics of this
  involved repurposing the fasl a? parameter to hold an annotation
  flags value when it is not #f and remaking annotations with
  new flags if necessary before emitting them.
    compile.ss, fasl.ss, misc.ms
- altered a number of mats to produce correct results even
  when the 's' directory is profiled.
    misc.ms, cp0.ms, record.ms
- profile-release-counters is now generation-friendly; that is,
  it doesn't look for dropped code objects in generations that have
  not been collected since the last call to profile-release-counters.
  also, it no longer allocates memory when it releases counters.
    pdhtml.ss,
    gc.c, gcwrapper.c, globals.h, prim5.c
- removed unused entry points S_ifile, S_ofile, and S_iofile
    alloc.c, externs.h
- mats that test loading profile info into the compiler's database
  to guide optimization now weed out preexisting entries, in case
  the 's' directory is profiled.
    4.ms, mat.ss, misc.ms, primvars.ms
- counters for dropped code objects are now released at the start
  of each mat group.
    mat.ss
- replaced ehc (enable-heap-check) option with hci (heap-check-interval)
  option that allows heap checks to be performed periodically rather
  than on each collection.  hci=0 is equivalent to ehc=f (disabling
  heap checks) and hci=1 is equivalent to ehc=t (enabling heap
  checks every collection), while hci=100 enables heap checks only
  every 100th collection.  allx and bullyx mats use this feature
  to reduce heap-checking overhead to a more reasonable level.  this
  is particularly important when the 's' directory is profiled,
  since the amount of static memory to be checked is greatly increased
  due to the counters.
    mats/Mf-base, mat.ss, primvars.ms
- added a mat that calls #%show-allocation, which was otherwise not
  being tested.
    misc.ms
- removed a broken primvars mat and updated two others.  in each case,
  the mat was looking for information about primitives in the wrong
  (i.e., old) place and silently succeeding when it didn't find any
  primitives to test.  the revised mats (along with a few others) now
  check to make sure at least one identifier has the information they
  look for.  the removed mat was checking for library information that
  is now compiled in, so the mat is now unnecessary.  the others were
  (not) doing argument-error checks.  fixing these turned up a handful of
  problems that have also been fixed: a couple of unbound variables in the
  mat driver, two broken primdata declarations, a tardy argument check
  by profile-load-data, and a bug in char-ready?, which was requiring
  an argument rather than defaulting it to the current input port.
    primdata.ss, pdhtml.ss, io.ms,
    primdvars.ms, 4.ms, 6.ms, misc.ms, patch*
- added initial support for recording coverage information.  when the
  new parameter generate-covin-files is set, the compiler generates
  .covin files containing the universe of all source objects for which
  profile forms are present in the expander output.  when profiling
  and generation of covin files are enabled in the 's' directory, the
  mats optionally generate .covout files for each mat file giving
  the subset of the universe covered by the mat file, along with an
  all.covout in each mat output directory aggregating the coverage
  for the directory and another all.covout in the top-level mat
  directory aggregating the coverage for all directories.
    back.ss, compile.ss, cprep.ss, primdata.ss, s/Mf-base,
    mat.ss, mats/Mf-base, mats/primvars.ms
- support for generating covout files is now built in.  with-coverage-output
  gathers and dumps coverage information, and aggregate-coverage-output
  combines (aggregates) covout files.
    pdhtml.ss, primdata.ss, compile.ss,
    mat.ss, mats/Mf-base, primvars.ms
- profile-clear now adjusts active coverage trackers to avoid losing
  coverage information.
    pdhtml.ss,
    prim5.c
- nested with-coverage calls are now supported.
    pdhtml.ss
- switched to a more compact representation for covin and covout files;
  reduces disk space (compressed or not) by about a factor of four
  and read time by about a factor of two with no increase in write time.
    primdata.ss, pdhtml.ss, cprep.ss, compile.ss,
    mat.ss, mats/Mf-base
- added support for determining coverage for an entire run, including
  coverage for expressions hit during boot time.  'all' mats now produce
  run.covout files in each output directory, and 'allx' mats produce
  an aggregate run.covout file in the mat directory.
    pdhtml.ss,
    mat.ss, mats/Mf-base
- profile-release-counters now adjusts active coverage trackers to
  account for the counters that have been released.
    pdhtml.ss,
    prim5.c
- replaced the artificial "examples" target with a real "build-examples"
  target so make won't think it always has to mats that depend upon
  the examples directory having been compiled.  mats make clean now
  runs make clean in the examples directory.
    mats/Mf-base
- importing a library from an object file now just visits the object
  file rather than doing a full load so that the run-time code for
  the library is not retained.  The run-time code is still read
  because the current fasl format forces the entire file to be read,
  but not retaining the code can lower heap size and garbage-collection
  cost, particularly when many object-code libraries are imported.
  The downside is that the file must be revisited if the run-time
  code turns out to be required.   This change exposed several
  places where the code was failing to check if a revisit is needed.
    syntax.ss,
    7.ms, 8.ms, misc.ms, root-experr*
- fixed typos: was passing unquoted load rather than quoted load
  to $load-library along one path (where it is loading source code
  and therefore irrelevant), and was reporting src-path rather than
  obj-path in a message about failing to define a library.
    syntax.ss
- compile-file and friends now put all recompile information in
  the first fasl object after the header so the library manager can
  find it without loading the entire fasl file.  The library manager
  now does so.  It also now checks to see if library object files
  need to be recreated before loading them rather than loading them and
  possibly recompiling them after discovering they are out of date, since
  the latter requires loading the full object file even if it's out of
  date, while the former takes advantage of the ability to extract just
  recompile information.  as well as reducing overhead, this eliminates
  possibly undesirable side effects, such as creation and registration
  of out-of-date nongenerative record-type descriptors.  because the
  library manager expects to find recompile information at the front of
  an object file, it will not find all recompile information if object
  files are "catted" together.  also, compile-file has to hold in memory
  the object code for all expressions in the file so that it can emit the
  unified recompile information, rather than writing to the object file
  incrementally, which can significantly increase the memory required
  to compile a large file full of individual top-level forms.  This does
  not affect top-level programs, which were already handled as a whole,
  or a typical library file that contains just a single library form.
    compile.ss, syntax.ss
- the library manager now checks include files before library dependencies
  when compile-imported-libraries is false (as it already did when
  compile-imported-libraries is true) in case a source change affects
  the set of imported libraries.  (A library change can affect the set
  of include files as well, but checking dependencies before include
  files can cause unneeded libraries to be loaded.)  The include-file
  check is based on recompile-info rather than dependencies, but the
  library checks are still based on dependencies.
    syntax.ss
- fixed check for binding of scheme-version. (the check prevents
  premature treatment of recompile-info records as Lexpand forms
  to be passed to $interpret-backend.)
    scheme.c
- strip-fasl-file now preserves recompile-info when compile-time info
  is stripped.
    strip.ss
- removed include-req* from library/ct-info and ctdesc records; it
  is no longer needed now that all recompile information is maintained
  separately.
    expand-lang.ss, syntax.ss, compile.ss, cprep.ss, syntax.ss
- changed the fasl format and reworked a lot of code in the expander,
  compiler, fasl writer, and fasl reader to allow the fasl reader
  to skip past run-time information when it isn't needed and
  compile-time information when it isn't needed.  Skipping past
  still involves reading and decoding when encrypted, but the fasl
  reader no longer parses or allocates code and data in the portions
  to be skipped.  Side effects of associating record uids with rtds
  are also avoided, as are the side effects of interning symbols
  present only in the skipped data.  Skipping past code objects
  also reduces or eliminates the need to synchronize data and
  instruction caches.  Since the fasl reader no longer returns
  compile-time (visit) or run-time (revisit) code and data when not
  needed, the fasl reader no longer wraps these objects in a pair
  with a 0 or 1 visit or revisit marker.  To support this change,
  the fasl writer generates separate top-level fasl entries (and
  graphs) for separate forms in the same top-level source form
  (e.g., begin or library).  This reliably breaks eq-ness of shared
  structure across these forms, which was previously broken only
  when visit or revisit code was loaded at different times (this
  is an incompatible change).  Because of the change, fasl "groups"
  are no longer needed, so they are no longer handled.
    7.ss, cmacros.ss, compile.ss, expand-lang.ss, strip.ss,
    externs.h, fasl.c, scheme.c,
    hash.ms
- the change above is surfaced in an optional fasl-read "situation"
  argument (visit, revisit, or load).  The default is load.  visit
  causes it to skip past revisit code and data; revisit causes it
  to skip past visit code and data; and load causes it not to skip
  past either.  visit-revisit data produced by (eval-when (visit
  revisit) ---) is never skipped.
    7.ss, primdata.ss,
    io.stex
- to improve compile-time and run-time error checking, the
  Lexpand recompile-info, library/rt-info, library-ct-info, and
  program-info forms have been replaced with list-structured forms,
  e.g., (recompile-info ,rcinfo).
    expand-lang.ss, compile.ss, cprep.ss, interpret.ss, syntax.ss
- added visit-compiled-from-port and revisit-compiled-from-port
  to complement the existing load-compiled-from-port.
    7.ss, primdata.ss,
    7.ms,
    system.stex
- increased amount read when seeking an lz4-compressed input
  file from 32 to 1024 bytes at a time
    compress-io.c
- replaced the fasl a? parameter value #t with an "all" flag value
  so it's value is consistently a mask.
    cmacros.ss, fasl.ss, compile.ss
- split off profile mats into a separate file
    misc.ms, profile.ms (new), root-experr*, mats/Mf-base
- added coverage percent computations to mat allx/bullyx output
    mat.ss, mats/Mf-base, primvars.ms
- replaced coverage tables with more generic and generally useful
  source tables, which map source objects to arbitrary values.
    pdhtml.ss, compile.ss, cprep.ss, primdata.ss,
    mat.ss, mats/Mf-base, primvars.ms, profile.ms,
    syntax.stex
- reduced profile counting overhead by using calls to fold-left
  instead of calls to apply and map and by using fixnum operations
  for profile counts on 64-bit machines.
    pdhtml.ss
- used a critical section to fix a race condition in the calculations
  of profile counts that sometimes resulted in bogus (including
  negative) counts, especially when the 's' directory is profiled.
    pdhtml.ss
- added discard flag to declaration for hashtable-size
    primdata.ss
- redesigned the printed representation of source tables and rewrote
  get-source-table! to read and store incrementally to reduce memory
  overhead.
    compile.ss
- added generate-covin-files to the set of parameters preserved
  by compile-file, etc.
    compile.ss,
    system.stex
- moved covop argument before the undocumented machine and hostop
  arguments to compile-port and compile-to-port.  removed the
  undocumented ofn argument from compile-to-port; using
  (port-name ip) instead.
    compile.ss, primdata.ss,
    7.ms,
    system.stex
- compile-port now tries to come up with a file position to supply
  to make-read, which it can do if the port's positions are character
  positions (presently string ports) or if the port is positioned
  at zero.
    compile.ss
- audited the argument-type-error fuzz mat exceptions and fixed a
  host of problems this turned up (entries follow).  added #f as
  an invalid argument for every type for which #f is indeed invalid
  to catch places where the maybe- prefix was missing on the argument
  type.  the mat tries hard to determine if the condition raised
  (if any) as the result of an invalid argument is appropriate and
  redirects the remainder to the mat-output (.mo) file prefixed
  with 'Expected error', causing them to show up in the expected
  error output so developers will be encouraged to audit them in
  the future.
    primvars.ms, mat.ss
- added an initial symbol? test on machine type names so we produce
  an invalid machine type error message rather than something
  confusing like "machine type #f is not supported".
    compile.ss
- fixed declarations for many primitives that were specified as
  accepting arguments of more general types than they actually
  accept, such as number -> real for various numeric operations,
  symbol -> endianness for various bytevector operations,
  time -> time-utc for time-utc->date, and list -> list-of-string-pairs
  for default-library-search-handler.   also replaced some of the
  sub-xxxx types with specific types such as sub-symbol -> endianness
  in utf16->string, but only where they were causing issues with
  the primvars argument-type-error fuzz mat.  (this should be done
  more generally.)
    primdata.ss
- fixed incorrect who arguments (was map instead of fold-right,
  current-date instead of time-utc->date); switched to using
  define-who/set-who! generally.
    4.ss, date.ss
- append! now checks all arguments before any mutation
    5_2.ss
- with-source-path now properly supplies itself as who for the
  string? argument check; callers like load now do their own checks.
    7.ss
- added missing integer? check to $fold-bytevector-native-ref whose
  lack could have resulted in a compile-time error.
    cp0.ss
- fixed typo in output-port-buffer-mode error message
    io.ss
- fixed who argument (was fx< rather than fx<?)
    library.ss
- fixed declaration of first source-file-descriptor argument (was
  sfd, now string)
    primdata.ss
- added missing article 'a' in a few error messages
    prims.ss
- fixed the copy-environment argument-type error message for the list
  of symbols argument.
    syntax.ss
- the environment procedure now catches exceptions that occur and
  reraises the exception with itself as who if the condition isn't
  already a who condition.
    syntax.ss
- updated experr and allx patch files for changes to argument-count
  fuzz mat and fixes for problems turned up by them.
    root-experr*, patch*
- fixed a couple of issues setting port sizes: string and bytevector
  output port put handlers don't need room to store the character
  or byte, so they now set the size to the buffer length rather
  than one less.  binary-file-port-clear-output now sets the index
  rather than size to zero; setting the size to zero is inappropriate
  for some types of ports and could result in loss of buffering and
  even suppression of future output.  removed a couple of redundant
  sets of the size that occur immediately after setting the buffer.
    io.ss
- it is now possible to return from a call to with-profile-tracker
  multiple times and not double-count (or worse) any counts.
    pdhtml.ss, profile.ms
- read-token now requires a file position when it is handed a
  source-file descriptor (since the source-file descriptor isn't
  otherwise useful), and the source-file descriptor argument can
  no longer be #f.  the input file position plays the same role as
  the input file position in get-datum/annotations.  these extra
  read-token arguments are now documented.
    read.ss,
    6.ms,
    io.stex
- the source-file descriptor argument to get-datum/annotations can
  no longer be #f.  it was already documented that way.
    read.ss
- read-token and do-read now look for the character-positions port
  flag before asking if the port has port-position, since the latter
  is slightly more expensive.
    read.ss
- rd-error now reports the current port position if it can be determined
  when fp isn't already set, i.e., when reading from a port without
  character positions (presently any non string port) and fp has not
  been passed in explicitly (to read-token or get-datum/annotations).
  the port position might not be a character position, but it should be
  better than nothing.
    read.ss
- added comment noting an invariant for s_profile_release_counters.
    prim5.c
- restored accidentally dropped fasl-write formdef and dropped
  duplicate fasl-read formdef
    io.stex
- added a 'coverage' target that tests the coverage of the Scheme-code
  portions of Chez Scheme by the mats.
    Makefile.in, Makefile-workarea.in
- added .PHONY declarations for all of the targets in the top-level
  and workarea make files, and renamed the create-bintar, create-rpm,
  and create-pkg targets bintar, rpm, and pkg.
    Makefile.in, Makefile-workarea.in
- added missing --retain-static-relocation command-line argument and
  updated the date
    scheme.1.in
- removed a few redundant conditional variable settings
    configure
- fixed declaration of condition wait (timeout -> maybe-timeout)
    primdata.ms
- added "invalid code page ~s" to set of messages considered valid
  argument-type-check error messages, for Windows multibyte->string
  and string->multibyte.
    primvars.ms
- used with-object-file to restore accidentally dropped close-port in
  compile-whole-program and compile-whole-library
    compile.ss
- initialized variable to enable compilation with gcc 9.1.0 at -O3
    c/scheme.c
- added missing Inner wrappers around the library/ct-info and
  library-rt-info records in the code for compile-whole-xxx.
    compile.ss,
    7.ms
- local-eval-hook now calls eval rather than interpret when profiling
  is enabled, so local transformer code can be profiled.
    syntax.ss,
    profile.ms
- fix compiler bug related to call-with-values and a first argument
  whose body result is compiled to an allocation, inline form, or
  foreign call
    cpnanopass.ss, 3.ms
- improved error reporting for library compilation-instance errors:
  now including the name of the object file from which the "wrong"
  compilation instance was loaded, if it was loaded from (or compiled
  to) an object file and the original importing library, if it was
  previously loaded from an object file due to a library import.
    syntax.ss, 7.ss, interpret.ss,
    8.ms, root-experr*
- removed situation and for-input? arguments from $make-load-binary,
  since the only consumer always passes 'load and #f.
    7.ss,
    scheme.c
- $separate-eval now prints the stderr and stdout of the subprocess
  to help in diagnosing separate-eval and separate-compile issues.
    mat.ss
- added unregister-guardian, which can be used to unregister
  the unressurected objects registered with any guardian.  guardian?
  can be used to distinguish guardian procedures from other objects.

    release_notes.stex
    smgmt.stex, threads.stex
- added verify-loadability.  given a situation (visit, revisit,
  or load) and zero or more pathnames (each of which may be optionally
  paired with a library search path), verity-loadability checks
  whether the set of object files named by those pathnames and any
  additional object files required by library requirements in the
  given situation can be loaded together.  it raises an exception
  in each case where actually attempting to load the files would
  raise an exception and additionally in cases where loading files
  would result in the compilation or loading of source files in
  place of the object files.  if the check is successful,
  verity-loadability returns an unspecified value.  in either case,
  although portions of the object files are read, none of the
  information read from the object files is retained, and none of
  the object code is read, so there are no side effects other than
  the file operations and possibly the raising of an exception.
  library and program info records are now moved to the top of each
  object file produced by one of the file compilation routines,
  just after recompile info, with a marker to allow verity-loadability
  to stop reading once it reads all such records.  this change is
  not entirely backward compatible; the repositioning of the records
  can be detected by a call to list-library made from a loaded file
  before the definition of one or more libraries.  it is fully
  backward compatible for typical library files that contain a
  single library definition and nothing else.  adding this feature
  required changes to the object-file format and corresponding
  changes in the compiler and library manager.  it also required
  moving cross-library optimization information from library/ct-info
  records (which verity-loadability must read) to the invoke-code
  for each library (which verity-loadability  does not read) to
  avoid reading and permanently associating record-type descriptors
  in the code with their uids.
    compile.ss, syntax.ss, expand-lang.ss, primdata.ss, 7.ss,
    7.ms, misc.ms, root-experr*, patch*,
    system.stex, release_notes.stex
- fixed a bug that bit only with the compiler compiled at
  optimize-level 2: add-library/rt-records was building a library/ct-info
  wrapper rather than a library/rt-info wrapper.
    compile.ss
- fixed a bug in visit-library that could result in an indefinite
  recursion: it was not checking to make sure the call to $visit
  actually added compile-time info to the libdesc record.  it's not
  clear, however, whether the libdesc record can be missing
  compile-time information on entry to visit-library, so the code
  that calls $visit (and now checks for compile-time information
  having been added) might not be reachable.  ditto for
  revisit-library.
    syntax.ss
    syntax.ss, primdata.ss,
    7.ms, root-experr*, patch*,
    system.stex, release_notes.stex
- added some argument-error checks for library-directories and
  library-extensions, and fixed up the error messages a bit.
    syntax.ss,
    7.ms, root-experr*
- compile-whole-program now inserts the program record into the
  object file for the benefit of verify-loadability.
    syntax.ss,
    7.ms, root-experr*
- changed 'loading' import-notify messages to the more precise
  'visiting' or 'revisiting' in a couple of places.
    syntax.ss,
    7.ms, 8.ms
- added concatenate-object-files
    compile.ss, primdata.ss
    7.ms, root-experr*
    system.stex, use.stex, release_notes.stex
- added invoke-library
    syntax.ss, primdata.ss,
    8.ms, root-experr*,
    libraries.stex, release_notes.stex
- updated the date
    release_notes.stex
- libraries contained within a whole program or library are now
  marked pending before their invoke code is run so that invoke
  cycles are reported as such rather than as attempts to invoke
  while still loading.
    compile.ss, syntax.ss, primdata.ss,
    7.ms, root-experr*
- the library manager now protects against unbound references 
  from separately compiled libraries or programs to identifiers
  ostensibly but not actually exported by (invisible) libraries
  that exist only locally within a whole program.  this is done by
  marking the invisibility of the library in the library-info and
  propagating it to libdesc records; the latter is checked upon
  library import, visit, and invoke as well as by verify-loadability.
  the import and visit code of each invisible no longer complains
  about invisibility since it shouldn't be reachable.
    syntax.ss, compile.ss, expand-lang.ss,
    7.ms, 8.ms, root-experr*, patch*
- documented that compile-whole-xxx's linearization of the
  library initialization code based on static dependencies might
  not work for dynamic dependencies.
    system.stex
- optimized bignum right shifts so the code (1) doesn't look at
  shifted-off bigits if the bignum is positive, since it doesn't
  need to know in that case if any bits are set; (2) doesn't look
  at shifted-off bigits if the bignum is negative if it determines
  that at least one bit is set in the bits shifted off the low-order
  partially retained bigit; (3) quits looking, if it must look, for
  one bits as soon as it finds one; (4) looks from both ends under
  the assumption that set bits, if any, are most likely to be found
  toward the high or low end of the bignum rather than just in the
  middle; and (5) doesn't copy the retained bigits and then shift;
  rather shifts as it copies.  This leads to dramatic improvements
  when the shift count is large and often significant improvements
  otherwise.
    number.c,
    5_3.ms,
    release_notes.stex
- threaded tc argument through to all calls to S_bignum and
  S_trunc_rem so they don't have to call get_thread_context()
  when it might already have been called.
    alloc.c, number.c, fasl.c, print.c, prim5.c, externs.h
- added an expand-primitive handler to partially inline integer?.
    cpnanopass.ss
- added some special cases for basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *,
  /, quotient, remainder, and the div/div0/mod/mod0 operations) to
  avoid doing unnecessary work for large bignums when the result
  will be zero (e.g,. multiplying by 0), the same as one of the
  inputs (e.g., adding 0 or multiplying by 1), or the additive
  inverse of one of the inputs (e.g., subtracting from 0, dividing
  by -1).  This can have a major beneficial affect when operating
  on large bignums in the cases handled.  also converted some uses
  of / into integer/ where going through the former would just add
  overhead without the possibility of optimization.
    5_3.ss,
    number.c, externs.h, prim5.c,
    5_3.ms, root-experr, patch*,
    release_notes.stex
- added a queue to hold pending signals for which handlers have
  been registered via register-signal-handler so up to 63 (configurable
  in the source code) unhandled signals are buffered before the
  handler has to start dropping them.
    cmacros.ss, library.ss, prims.ss, primdata.ss,
    schsig.c, externs.h, prim5.c, thread.c, gc.c,

- bytevector-compress now selects the level of compression based
  on the compress-level parameter.  Prior to this it always used a
  default setting for compression.  the compress-level parameter
  can now take on the new minimum in addition to low, medium, high,
  and maximum.  minimum is presently treated the same as low
  except in the case of lz4 bytevector compression, where it
  results in the use of LZ4_compress_default rather than the
  slower but more effective LZ4_compress_HC.

- fix fasl-read signature
    primdata.ss
- console I/O on Windows now supports Unicode characters in the BMP
    expeditor.c, new-io.c, release_notes.stex
- the collector now releases bignum temporaries in the collector
  rather than relocating them so we don't keep around huge bignum
  temporaries forever.
     gc.c
- removed the presumably useless vector-handling code from load()
  which used to be required to handle fasl groups.
     scheme.c
- object files are no longer compressed as a whole, and the parameter
  compile-compressed is no longer defined.  instead, the individual
  fasl objects within an object file are compressed whenever the
  new parameter fasl-compressed is set to its default value, #t.
  this allows the fasl reader to seek past portions of an object
  file that are not of interest, i.e., visit-only code and data
  when "revisiting" an object file and revisit-only code and data
  when "visiting" an object file.  the compressed portions are
  compressed using the format and level specified by the compress-format
  and compress-level parameters.  the C-coded fasl reader and
  boot-file loader no longer handle compressed files; these are
  handled, less efficiently, by the Scheme entry point (fasl-read).
  a warning exception is raised the first time a program attempts
  to create or read a compressed fasl file.

    intro.stex, use.stex, io.stex, system.stex,
    release_notes.stex
- added begin wrappers around many of the Scheme source files that
  contained multiple expressions to cut down the number of top-level
  fasl objects and increase compressibility.  also removed the
  string filenames for debugging at the start of each file that had
  one---these are best inserted universally by a modified compile-file
  during a debugging session when desired.  also removed unnecessary
  top-level placeholder definitions for the assignments that follow.
