\section{Exceptions\label{SECTSYSTEMEXCEPTIONS}}

\index{exception handling}{\ChezScheme} provides some extensions to the
Revised$^6$ Report exception-handling mechanism, including mechanisms
for producing formatted error messages, displaying conditions,
and redefining the base exception handler.
These extensions are described in this section.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{warning}{\categoryprocedure}{(warning \var{who} \var{msg} \var{irritant} \dots)}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\scheme{warning} raises a continuable exception with condition type
\scheme{&warning} and should be used to describe situations for which the
\scheme{&warning} condition type is appropriate, typically a situation
that should not prevent the program from continuing but might result
in a more serious problem at some later point.

The continuation object with which the exception is raised also includes
a \scheme{&who} condition whose who field is \var{who} if \var{who} is
not \scheme{#f}, a \scheme{&message} condition whose message field is
\var{msg}, and an \scheme{&irritants} condition whose irritants field
is \scheme{(\var{irritant} \dots)}.

\var{who} must be a string, a symbol, or \scheme{#f} identifying the procedure
or syntactic form reporting the warning.
It is usually best to identify a procedure the programmer has called rather
than some other procedure the programmer may not be aware is involved in
carrying out the operation.
\var{msg} must be a string and should describe the exceptional situation.
The irritants may be any Scheme objects and should include values that may
have caused or been materially involved in the exceptional situation.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{assertion-violationf}{\categoryprocedure}{(assertion-violationf \var{who} \var{msg} \var{irritant} \dots)}
\returns does not return
\formdef{errorf}{\categoryprocedure}{(errorf \var{who} \var{msg} \var{irritant} \dots)}
\returns does not return
\formdef{warningf}{\categoryprocedure}{(warningf \var{who} \var{msg} \var{irritant} \dots)}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\index{formatted error messages}%
These procedures are like \scheme{assertion-violation}, \scheme{error},
and \scheme{warning} except
that \var{msg} is assumed to be a format string, as if in a call to
\scheme{format} (Section~\ref{SECTFORMAT}), with
\scheme{\var{irritant} \dots} treated as the additional arguments to
\scheme{format}.
This allows programs to control the appearance of the error message, at
least when the default exception handler is in place.

For each of these procedures, the continuation object with which the exception
is raised includes a \scheme{&format} condition to signify that the string
contained in the condition object's \scheme{&message} condition is a
\scheme{format} string and the objects contained in the condition object's
\scheme{&irritants} condition should be treated as the additional
\scheme{format} arguments.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\conditionformdef{(define-condition-type &format &condition
  make-format-condition format-condition?)}
\endentryheader

\noindent
Presence of this condition type within a compound condition indicates
that the string provided by the \scheme{&message} condition, if
present, is a \scheme{format} string and the list of objects provided by
the \scheme{&irritants} condition, if present, should be treated as
additional \scheme{format} arguments.
\showit


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\conditionformdef{(define-condition-type &source &condition
  make-source-condition source-condition?
  (form source-condition-form))}
\endentryheader

\noindent
This condition type can be included within a compound condition when a
source expression can be identified in situations in which a
\scheme{&syntax} condition would be inappropriate, such as when a
run-time assertion violation is detected.
The \scheme{form} argument should be an s-expression or syntax object
representing the source expression.
\showit


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\conditionformdef{(define-condition-type &continuation &condition
  make-continuation-condition continuation-condition?
  (continuation condition-continuation))}
\endentryheader

\noindent
This condition type can be included within a compound condition to indicate
the current continuation at the point where the exception described by the
condition occurred.
The continuation of a failed \scheme{assert} or a call to
\scheme{assertion-violation}, \scheme{assertion-violationf},
\scheme{error}, \scheme{errorf}, or \scheme{syntax-error} is now included
via this condition type in the conditions passed to \scheme{raise}.
The \scheme{continuation} argument should be a continuation.
\showit

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{display-condition}{\categoryprocedure}{(display-condition \var{obj})}
\formdef{display-condition}{\categoryprocedure}{(display-condition \var{obj} \var{textual-output-port})}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

If \var{textual-output-port} is not supplied, it defaults to the current output port.
This procedure displays a message to the effect that an exception
has occurred with value \var{obj}.
If \var{obj} is a condition (Chapter~\ref{TSPL:CHPTEXCEPTIONS} of
{\TSPLFOUR}), it displays information encapsulated within the condition,
handling messages, \var{who} conditions, irritants, source information,
etc., as appropriate.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{default-exception-handler}{\categoryprocedure}{(default-exception-handler \var{obj})}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

This procedure is the default value of the \scheme{base-exception-handler}
parameter called on a condition when no other exception handler has been
defined or when all dynamically established exception handlers have chosen
not to handle the condition.
It first displays \var{obj}, as if with \scheme{display-condition}, to the
console error port.
For non-serious warning conditions, it returns immediately after displaying
the condition.

For serious or other non-warning conditions, it
saves the condition in the parameter \scheme{debug-condition}, where
\scheme{debug} (Section~\ref{SECTDEBUGINTERACTIVE}) can retrieve it and
allow it to be inspected.
If the \scheme{debug-on-exception} parameter is set to \scheme{#f} (the
default unless the \index{\scheme{--debug-on-exception} command-line
option}\scheme{--debug-on-exception} command-line option is provided), the
handler prints a message instructing the user to type \scheme{(debug)} to
enter the debugger, then resets to the current caf\'e.
Otherwise, the handler invokes \scheme{debug} directly and resets if
\scheme{debug} returns.

If an I/O exception occurs while attempting to display the condition,
the default exception handler resets (as if by calling \scheme{reset}).
The intent is to avoid an infinite regression (ultimately ending
in exhaustion of memory) in which the process repeatedly recurs
back to the default exception handler trying to write to a console-error
port (typically stderr) that is no longer writable, e.g., due to
the other end of a pipe or socket having been closed.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{debug-on-exception}{\categoryglobalparameter}{debug-on-exception}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

The value of this parameter determines whether the default exception handler
immediately enters the debugger immediately when it receives a serious or
non-warning condition.
If the \index{\scheme{--debug-on-exception} command-line option}\scheme{--debug-on-exception}
command-line option (Section~\ref{SECTUSEINTERACTION}) has been provided, the
initial value of this parameter is \scheme{#t}.
Otherwise, the initial value is \scheme{#f}.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{base-exception-handler}{\categorythreadparameter}{base-exception-handler}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

The value of this parameter must be a procedure, and the procedure
should accept one argument.
The default value of \scheme{base-exception-handler} is
the procedure \scheme{default-exception-handler}.

The value of this parameter is invoked whenever no exception handler
established by a program has chosen to handle an exception.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{debug-condition}{\categorythreadparameter}{debug-condition}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

This parameter is used by the default exception handler to hold the
last serious or non-warning condition received by the handler, where
it can be inspected via the \scheme{debug} procedure
(Section~\ref{SECTDEBUGINTERACTIVE}).
It can also be invoked by user code to store or retrieve a
condition.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{current-exception-state}{\categorythreadparameter}{current-exception-state}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\scheme{current-exception-state} may be used to get or set
the current exception state.
When called without arguments, \scheme{current-exception-state} returns
an \emph{exception state} comprising the current stack of handlers established
by \scheme{with-exception-handler} and \scheme{guard}.
When called with a single argument, which must be an exception state,
\scheme{current-exception-state} sets the exception state.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{create-exception-state}{\categoryprocedure}{(create-exception-state)}
\formdef{create-exception-state}{\categoryprocedure}{(create-exception-state \var{procedure})}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\scheme{create-exception-state} creates an exception
state whose stack of exception handlers is empty except for, in effect,
an infinite number of occurrences of \emph{handler} at its
base.
\var{handler} must be a procedure, and should accept one argument.
If not provided, \var{handler} defaults to a procedure equivalent
to the value of the following expression.

\schemedisplay
(lambda (x) ((base-exception-handler) x))
\endschemedisplay

\section{Interrupts\label{SECTSYSTEMINTERRUPTS}}

\index{interrupts}{\ChezScheme} allows programs to control
the action of the Scheme system when various events
occur, including an interrupt from the
keyboard, the expiration of an internal timer set by \scheme{set-timer},
a breakpoint caused by a call to \scheme{break}, or a request from the
storage manager to initiate a garbage collection.
These mechanisms are described in this section, except for the
collect request mechanism, which is described in Section~\ref{SECTSMGMTGC}.

Timer, keyboard, and collect-request interrupts are supported via a counter
that is decremented approximately once for each call to a nonleaf procedure.
(A leaf procedure is one that does not itself make any calls.)
When no timer is running, this counter is set to a default value (1000
in Version~9) when a program starts or after an interrupt occurs.
If a timer is set (via \scheme{set-timer}), the counter is set to the
minimum of the default value and the number of ticks to which the timer is
set.
When the counter reaches zero, the system looks to see if the timer
is set and has expired or if a keyboard or collect request interrupt
has occurred.
If so, the current procedure call is pended (``put on hold'') while the
appropriate interrupt handler is invoked to handle the interrupt.
When (if) the interrupt handler returns, the pended call takes place.
Thus, timer, keyboard, and collect-request interrupts effectively occur
synchronously with respect to the procedure call mechanism, and
keyboard and collect request interrupts may be delayed by a number
of calls equal to the default timer value.

Calls to the break handler occur immediately
whenever \scheme{break} is called.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{break}{\categoryprocedure}{(break \var{who} \var{msg} \var{irritant} \dots)}
\formdef{break}{\categoryprocedure}{(break \var{who})}
\formdef{break}{\categoryprocedure}{(break)}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
The arguments to \scheme{break} follow the protocol described above for
\scheme{errorf}.
The default break handler (see \scheme{break-handler}) displays a message and
invokes the \index{debugger}debugger.
The format string and objects may be omitted, in which case the
message issued by the default break handler identifies the break
using the \var{who} argument but provides no more information
about the break.
If the \var{who} argument is omitted as well, no message is generated.
The default break handler returns normally if the debugger
exits normally.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{break-handler}{\categorythreadparameter}{break-handler}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
The value of this parameter must be a procedure.
The current break handler is called by \scheme{break}, which passes
along its arguments.
See \scheme{break} for a description of the default break
handler.
The example below shows how to disable breaks.

\schemedisplay
(break-handler (lambda args (void)))
\endschemedisplay


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{keyboard-interrupt-handler}{\categorythreadparameter}{keyboard-interrupt-handler}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
The value of this parameter must be a procedure.
The keyboard-interrupt handler is called (with no arguments) when
a keyboard interrupt occurs.
The default keyboard-interrupt handler invokes the interactive
\index{debugger}debugger.
If the debugger exits normally the interrupted computation is
resumed.
The example below shows how to install a keyboard-interrupt handler
that resets without invoking the debugger.

\schemedisplay
(keyboard-interrupt-handler
  (lambda ()
    (newline (console-output-port))
    (reset)))
\endschemedisplay


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader\label{desc:set-timer}
\formdef{set-timer}{\categoryprocedure}{(set-timer \var{n})}
\returns previous current timer value
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\index{timer interrupts}\var{n} must be a nonnegative integer.
When \var{n} is nonzero, \scheme{set-timer} starts an internal timer with
an initial value of \var{n}.
When \var{n} ticks elapse, a timer interrupt occurs, resulting in
invocation of the timer interrupt handler.
Each tick corresponds roughly to one nonleaf procedure call (see the
introduction to this section); thus, ticks are not
uniform time units but instead depend heavily on how much work is done
by each procedure call.

When \var{n} is zero, \scheme{set-timer} turns the timer off.

The value returned in either case is the value of the timer before the
call to \scheme{set-timer}.
A return value of 0 should not be taken to imply that the timer was not on;
the return value may also be 0 if the timer was just about to fire when
the call to \scheme{set-timer} occurred.

The engine mechanism (Section~\ref{SECTENGINES}) is built on top of the
timer interrupt so timer interrupts should not be used with engines.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{timer-interrupt-handler}{\categorythreadparameter}{timer-interrupt-handler}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\index{timer interrupts}The value of this parameter must be a procedure.
The timer interrupt handler is called by the system when the internal timer
(set by \scheme{set-timer}) expires.
The default handler raises an exception with condition type \scheme{&assertion}
to say that the handler has not
been defined; any program that uses the timer should redefine the
handler before setting the timer.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{disable-interrupts}{\categoryprocedure}{(disable-interrupts)}
\formdef{enable-interrupts}{\categoryprocedure}{(enable-interrupts)}
\returns disable count
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\scheme{disable-interrupts} disables the handling of interrupts,
including timer, keyboard, and collect request interrupts.
\scheme{enable-interrupts} re-enables these interrupts.
The system maintains a disable count that starts at zero; when zero,
interrupts are enabled.
Each call to \scheme{disable-interrupts} increments the count,
effectively disabling interrupts.
Each call to \scheme{enable-interrupts} decrements the count, if
not already zero, effectively enabling interrupts.
For example, two calls to \scheme{disable-interrupts} followed by one call to
\scheme{enable-interrupts} leaves interrupts disabled.
Calls to \scheme{enable-interrupts} when the count is already zero
(and interrupts are enabled) have no effect.
The value returned by either procedure is the number of calls to
\scheme{enable-interrupts} required to enable interrupts.

Great care should be exercised when using these procedures, since disabling
interrupts inhibits the normal processing of keyboard interrupts,
timer interrupts, and, perhaps most importantly, collect request interrupts.
Since garbage collection does not happen automatically when interrupts are
disabled, it is possible for the storage allocator to run out of space
unnecessarily should interrupts be disabled for a long period of time.

The \scheme{with-interrupts-disabled} syntactic form should be used instead of
these more primitive procedures whenever possible,
since \scheme{with-interrupts-disabled} ensures that interrupts are re-enabled
whenever a nonlocal exit occurs, such as when an exception is handled by
the default exception handler.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{with-interrupts-disabled}{\categorysyntax}{(with-interrupts-disabled \var{body_1} \var{body_2} \dots)}
\formdef{critical-section}{\categorysyntax}{(critical-section \var{body_1} \var{body_2} \dots)}
\returns the values of the body \scheme{\var{body_1} \var{body_2} \dots}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\scheme{with-interrupts-disabled} evaluates the body
\scheme{\var{body_1} \var{body_2} \dots} with interrupts disabled.
That is, upon entry, interrupts are disabled, and
upon exit, interrupts are re-enabled.
Thus, \scheme{with-interrupts-disabled} allows the implementation of indivisible
operations in nonthreaded versions of {\ChezScheme} or within a single thread
in threaded versions of {\ChezScheme}.
\scheme{critical-section} is the same as \scheme{with-interrupts-disabled} and
is provided for backward compatibility.

\scheme{with-interrupts-disabled} can be defined as follows.

\schemedisplay
(define-syntax with-interrupts-disabled
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(_ b1 b2 ...)
     (dynamic-wind
       disable-interrupts
       (lambda () b1 b2 ...)
       enable-interrupts)]))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
The use of \scheme{dynamic-wind} ensures that interrupts are
disabled whenever the body of the \scheme{with-interrupts-disabled} expression
is active and re-enabled whenever it is not.
Since calls to \scheme{disable-interrupts} are counted (see the
discussion under \scheme{disable-interrupts} and
\scheme{enable-interrupts} above), \scheme{with-interrupts-disabled}
expressions may be nested with the desired effect.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{register-signal-handler}{\categoryprocedure}{(register-signal-handler \var{sig} \var{procedure})}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\scheme{register-signal-handler} is used to
establish a signal handler for a given low-level signal.
\var{sig} must be an exact integer identifying a valid signal, and
\var{procedure} should accept one argument.
See your host system's \scheme{<signal.h>} or documentation for a list
of valid signals and their numbers.
After a signal handler for a given signal has been registered, receipt
of the specified signal results in a call to the handler.
The handler is passed the signal number, allowing the same handler to
be used for different signals while differentiating among them.

Signals handled in this fashion are treated like keyboard interrupts in
that the handler is not called immediately when the signal is delivered
to the process, but rather at some procedure call boundary after the
signal is delivered.
It is generally not a good idea, therefore, to establish handlers for
memory faults, illegal instructions, and the like, since the code that
causes the fault or illegal instruction will continue to execute
(presumably erroneously) for some time before the handler is invoked.
A finite amount of storage is used to buffer as-yet unhandled
signals, after which additional signals are dropped.

\scheme{register-signal-handler} is supported only on Unix-based
systems.


\section{Environments\label{SECTMISCENVIRONMENTS}}

Environments are first-class objects containing identifier bindings.
They are similar to modules but, unlike modules, may be manipulated
at run time.
Environments may be provided as optional arguments to \scheme{eval},
\scheme{expand}, and the procedures that define, assign, or
reference top-level values.

There are several built-in environments, and new environments can
be created by copying existing environments or selected bindings
from existing environments.

Environments can be mutable or immutable.
A mutable environment can be extended with new bindings, its
existing bindings can be modified, and its variables can be assigned.
An immutable environment cannot be modified in any of these ways.

\entryheader
\formdef{scheme-environment}{\categoryprocedure}{(scheme-environment)}
\returns an environment
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\scheme{scheme-environment} returns an environment containing
the initial top-level bindings.
This environment corresponds to the \scheme{scheme} module.

The environment returned by this procedure is immutable.

\schemedisplay
(define cons 3)

(set-top-level-value! 'cons 3 (scheme-environment)) ;=> \var{exception}
\endschemedisplay

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{ieee-environment}{\categoryprocedure}{(ieee-environment)}
\returns an IEEE/ANSI standard compatibility environment
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\scheme{ieee-environment} returns an environment containing
bindings for the keywords and variables whose meanings are
defined by the IEEE/ANSI Standard for Scheme~\cite{IEEE:1178}.

The bindings for each of the identifiers in the IEEE environment are those
of the corresponding Revised$^6$ Report library, so this does not provide
full backward compatibility.

The environment returned by this procedure is immutable.

\schemedisplay
(define cons 3)
(top-level-value 'cons (ieee-environment)) ;=> #<procedure cons>
(set-top-level-value! 'cons 3 (ieee-environment)) ;=> \var{exception}
\endschemedisplay

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{interaction-environment}{\categorythreadparameter}{interaction-environment}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
The original value of \scheme{interaction-environment} is the default
top-level environment.
It is initially set to a mutable copy of
\scheme{(scheme-environment)} and which may be extended or otherwise
altered by top-level definitions and assignments.
It may be set to any environment, mutable or not, to change the
default top-level evaluation environment.

An expression's top-level bindings resolve to the environment that is
in effect when the expression is expanded, and changing the value
of this parameter has no effect on running code.
Changes affect only code that is subsequently expanded, e.g., as the
result of a call to \scheme{eval}, \scheme{load}, or
\scheme{compile-file}.

\schemedisplay
(define cons 3)
cons ;=> 3

\formdef{copy-environment}{\categoryprocedure}{(copy-environment \var{env} \var{mutable?} \var{syms})}
\returns a new environment
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\scheme{copy-environment} returns a copy of \var{env}, i.e., a new
environment that contains the same bindings as \var{env}.

The environment is mutable if \var{mutable?} is omitted or true;
if \var{mutable?} is false, the environment is immutable.

The set of bindings copied from \var{env} to the new environment
is determined by \var{syms}, which defaults to the value of
\scheme{(environment-symbols \var{env})}.
The binding, if any, for each element of \var{syms} is copied to the
new environment, and no other bindings are present in the new
environment.

In the current implementation, the storage space used by an environment
is never collected, so repeated use of \scheme{copy-environment} will
eventually cause the system to run out of memory.

\formdef{apropos-list}{\categoryprocedure}{(apropos-list \var{s} \var{env})}
\returns see below
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

This procedure returns a selected list of symbols and pairs.
Each symbol in the list represents an identifier bound in \var{env}.
Each pair represents a set of identifiers exported by a
predefined library or a library previously defined or loaded
into the system.
The car of the pair is the library name, and the cdr is a list
of symbols.
If \var{s} is a string, only entries whose names have \var{s} as a
substring are included, and if \var{s} is a symbol, only those whose names
have the name of \var{s} as a substring are selected.
If no environment is provided, it defaults to the value of
\scheme{interaction-environment}.

\formdef{eval}{\categoryprocedure}{(eval \var{obj} \var{env})}
\returns value of the Scheme form represented by \var{obj}
\listlibraries
\endnoskipentryheader

\noindent
\scheme{eval} treats \var{obj} as the representation of an expression.
It evaluates the expression in environment \var{env} and returns
its value.
If no environment is provided, it defaults to the environment
returned by \scheme{interaction-environment}.

Single-argument \scheme{eval} is a {\ChezScheme} extension.
{\ChezScheme} also permits \var{obj} to be the representation of a
nonexpression form, i.e., a definition, whenever the environment
is mutable.
{\ChezScheme} further allows \var{obj} to be an annotation
(Section~\ref{SECTSYNTAXANNOTATIONS}), and the default evaluators
make use of annotations to incorporate source-file
information in error messages and associate source-file
information with compiled code.

In {\ChezScheme}, \scheme{eval} is actually a wrapper that simply
passes its arguments to the current evaluator.
(See \scheme{current-eval}.)
The default evaluator is \scheme{compile}, which expands the
expression via the current expander (see
\scheme{current-expand}), compiles it,
executes the resulting code, and returns its value.
If the environment argument, \var{env}, is present,
\scheme{compile} passes it along to the current expander,
which is \scheme{sc-expand} by default.

\scheme{current-eval} determines the evaluation procedure used by the
procedures \index{\scheme{eval}}\scheme{eval}, \scheme{load}, and
\scheme{new-cafe}.
\scheme{current-eval} is initially bound to the value of
\index{\scheme{compile}}\scheme{compile}.
(In {\PetiteChezScheme}, it is initially bound to the value of
\index{\scheme{interpret}}\scheme{interpret}.)
The evaluation procedure should expect one or two arguments: an object
to evaluate and an optional environment.
The second argument might be an annotation
(Section~\ref{SECTSYNTAXANNOTATIONS}).

\noindent
\var{obj}, which can be an annotation (Section~\ref{SECTSYNTAXANNOTATIONS})
or unannotated value, is treated as a Scheme expression, expanded with the
current expander (the value of \scheme{current-expand}) in the specified
environment (or the interaction environment, if no environment
is provided), compiled to machine code, and executed.
\scheme{compile} is the default value of the \scheme{current-eval}
parameter.

\formdef{interpret}{\categoryprocedure}{(interpret \var{obj} \var{env})}
\returns value of the Scheme form represented by \var{obj}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\scheme{interpret} is like \scheme{compile}, except that the expression
is interpreted rather than compiled.
\scheme{interpret} may be used as a replacement for \scheme{compile},
with the following caveats:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Interpreted code runs significantly slower.

\item
Inspector information is not generated for
interpreted code, so the inspector is not as useful for interpreted
code as it is for compiled code.

\item
Foreign procedure expressions cannot be
interpreted, so the interpreter invokes the compiler for all
foreign procedure expressions (this is done transparently).
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\scheme{interpret} is sometimes faster than \scheme{compile} when the
form to be evaluated is short running, since it avoids some of the
work done by \scheme{compile} prior to evaluation.

\formdef{load}{\categoryprocedure}{(load \var{path} \var{eval-proc})}

\noindent
\var{path} must be a string.
\scheme{load} reads and evaluates the contents of the file specified by
\var{path}.
The file may contain source or object code.
By default, \scheme{load} employs \scheme{eval} to evaluate each source
expression found in a source file.
If \var{eval-proc} is specified, \scheme{load} uses this procedure instead.
\var{eval-proc} must accept one argument, the expression to evaluate.
The expression passed to \var{eval-proc} might be an annotation
(Section~\ref{SECTSYNTAXANNOTATIONS}) or an unannotated value.

The \var{eval-proc} argument
facilitates the implementation of embedded Scheme-like languages
and the use of alternate
evaluation mechanisms to be used for Scheme programs.
\var{eval-proc} can be put to other uses as well.
For example,

\schemedisplay
(load "myfile.ss"
  (lambda (x)
    (pretty-print
      (if (annotation? x)
          (annotation-stripped x)
          x))
    (newline)
    (eval x)))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
pretty-prints each expression before evaluating it.

\scheme{load-library} is identical to \scheme{load} except

\var{path} must be a string.
\scheme{load-program} reads and evaluates the contents of the file specified by
\var{path}.
The file may contain source or object code.
If it contains source code, \scheme{load-program} wraps
the code in a \scheme{top-level-program} form so that the file's
content is treated as an RNRS top-level program
(Section~\ref{TSPL:SECTLIBPROGRAMS} of {\TSPLFOUR}).
By default, \scheme{load-program} employs \scheme{eval} to evaluate each source
expression found in the file.
If \var{eval-proc} is specified, \scheme{load-program} uses this procedure instead.
\var{eval-proc} must accept one argument, the expression to evaluate.
The expression passed to \var{eval-proc} might be an annotation

\index{\scheme{source-directories}}%

\entryheader
\formdef{verify-loadability}{\categoryprocedure}{(verify-loadability \var{situation} \var{input} \dots)}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\var{situation} must be one of the symbols \scheme{visit}, \scheme{revisit}, or \scheme{load}.
Each \var{input} must be a string pathname or a pair of a string pathname and a library search path.
Each of the pathnames should name a file containing object code for a set of libraries and
top-level programs, such as would be produced by
\index{\scheme{compile-program}}\scheme{compile-program},
\index{\scheme{compile-library}}\scheme{compile-library},
\index{\scheme{compile-whole-program}}\scheme{compile-whole-program},
or
\index{\scheme{compile-whole-library}}\scheme{compile-whole-library}.
A library search path must be a suitable argument for
\index{\scheme{library-directories}}\scheme{library-directories}.

\scheme{verify-loadability} verifies, without actually loading any
code or defining any libraries, whether the object files named
by the specified pathnames and their library dependencies, direct
or indirect, are present, readable, and mutually compatible.
The type of dependencies for each named object file is determined
by the \var{situation} argument: compile-time dependencies for
\var{visit}, run-time dependencies for \var{revisit} and both for
\var{load}.

For each input pathname that is paired with a search path,
the \scheme{library-directories} parameter is parameterized to the
library search path during the recursive search for dependencies
of the programs and libraries found in the object file named by the
pathname.

If \scheme{verify-loadability} finds a problem, such as a missing
library dependency or compilation-instance mismatch, it raises an
exception with an appropriate condition.
Otherwise, it returns an unspecified value.

Since \scheme{verify-loadability} does not load or run any code
from the files it processes, it cannot determine whether errors
unrelated to missing or unreadable files or mutual compatibility
will occur when the files are actually loaded.

The return value is the value of the last expression whose compiled

\scheme{compile-script}, \scheme{compile-library}, and
\scheme{compile-to-port}.  In the process, it skips any revisit (run-time-only) code.

The return value is the value of the last expression whose last non-revisit compiled

\formdef{visit}{\categoryprocedure}{(visit \var{path})}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\var{path} must be a string.
\scheme{visit} reads the named file, which must contain compiled object
code compatible with the current machine type and version, and it
runs those portions of the compiled object code that
establish compile-time information or correspond to expressions
identified as ``visit'' time by \scheme{eval-when} forms contained in
the original source file.

For example, assume the file \scheme{t1.ss} contains the following
forms:

\schemedisplay
(define-syntax a (identifier-syntax 3))
(module m (x) (define x 4))
(define y 5)
\endschemedisplay

If \scheme{t1.ss} is compiled to \scheme{t1.so}, applying \scheme{load}
to \scheme{t1.so} has the effect of defining all three identifiers.
Applying \scheme{visit} to \scheme{t1.so}, however, has the effect of
installing the transformer for \scheme{a}, installing the interface for
\scheme{m} (for use by \scheme{import}),  and recording \scheme{y} as
a variable.
\scheme{visit} is useful when separately compiling one file that depends
on bindings defined in another without actually loading and evaluating
the code in the supporting file.

\index{\scheme{source-directories}}%
The parameter \scheme{source-directories} (Section~\ref{SECTSYSTEMSOURCE})
determines the set of directories searched for source files not identified
by absolute path names.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{revisit}{\categoryprocedure}{(revisit \var{path})}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\var{path} must be a string.
\scheme{revisit} reads the named file, which must contain compiled object
code compatible with the current machine type and version, and it
runs those portions of the compiled object code that compute
run-time values or correspond to expressions identified as ``revisit'' time by
\scheme{eval-when} forms contained in the original source file.

Continuing the example given for \scheme{visit} above,
applying \scheme{revisit} to the object file, \scheme{t1.so}, has
the effect of establishing the values of the variable \scheme{x}
exported from \scheme{m} and the top-level variable \scheme{y},
without installing either the interface for \scheme{m} or
the transformer for \scheme{a}.

\scheme{revisit} is useful for loading compiled application code without
loading unnecessary compile-time information.
Care must be taken when using this feature if the application calls
\scheme{eval} or uses \scheme{top-level-value},
\scheme{set-top-level-value!}, or \scheme{top-level-syntax} to access
top-level bindings at run-time, since these procedures use compile-time
information to resolve top-level bindings.

\index{\scheme{source-directories}}%
The parameter \scheme{source-directories} (Section~\ref{SECTSYSTEMSOURCE})
determines the set of directories searched for source files not identified
by absolute path names.

\formdef{compile-file}{\categoryprocedure}{(compile-file \var{input-filename} \var{output-filename})}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\var{input-filename} and \var{output-filename} must be strings.
\var{input-filename} must name an existing, readable file.
It must contain a sequence of zero or more source expressions;
if this is not the case, \scheme{compile-file} raises an exception
with condition type \scheme{&syntax}.

The normal evaluation process proceeds in two steps: \index{compilation}compilation and
execution.
\scheme{compile-file} performs the compilation process for an entire source
file, producing an object file.
When the object file is subsequently loaded (see \index{\scheme{load}}\scheme{load}), the
compilation process is not necessary, and the file typically loads
several times faster.

If the optional \var{output-filename} argument is omitted, the
actual input and output filenames are determined as follows.
If \var{input-filename} has no extension, the input filename
is \var{input-filename} followed by \scheme{.ss}  and the
output filename is \var{input-filename} followed by \scheme{.so}.
If \var{input-filename} has the extension \scheme{.so}, the
input filename is \var{input-filename} and the output filename
is \var{input-filename} followed by \scheme{.so}.
Otherwise, the input filename is \var{input-filename} and the
output filename is \var{input-filename} without its extension,
followed by \scheme{.so}.
For example, \scheme{(compile-file "myfile")} produces an object file
with the name \scheme{"myfile.so"} from the source file named
\scheme{"myfile.ss"}, \scheme{(compile-file "myfile.sls")} produces an
object file with the name \scheme{"myfile.so"} from the source file named
\scheme{"myfile.sls"}, and
\scheme{(compile-file "myfile1" "myfile2")} produces an object file with
the name \scheme{"myfile2"} from the source file name \scheme{"myfile1"}.

Before compiling a file, \scheme{compile-file} saves the values of the
following parameters:

\schemedisplay
optimize-level
debug-level
run-cp0
cp0-effort-limit
cp0-score-limit
cp0-outer-unroll-limit
generate-inspector-information
generate-procedure-source-information
compile-profile
generate-covin-files
generate-interrupt-trap
enable-cross-library-optimization
\endschemedisplay

It restores the values after the file has been compiled.
This allows the programmer to control the values of these parameters on
a per-file basis, e.g., via an \scheme{eval-when} with situation
\scheme{compile} embedded in the source file.
For example, if

\schemedisplay
(eval-when (compile) (optimize-level 3))
\endschemedisplay

appears at the top of a source file, the optimization level is set
to 3 just while the remainder of file is compiled.

\scheme{compile-script} is like \scheme{compile-file} but differs in
that it copies the leading \scheme{#!} line from the
source-file script into the object file.

\scheme{compile-script} permits compiled script files to be created from
source script to reduce script load time.

\var{input-filename} and \var{output-filename} must be strings.

\scheme{compile-program} is like \scheme{compile-script} but differs in
that it implements the semantics of RNRS top-level programs, while
\scheme{compile-script} implements the semantics of the interactive
top-level.
The resulting compiled program will also run faster than if compiled
via \scheme{compile-file} or \scheme{compile-script}.

\scheme{compile-program} returns a list of libraries directly
invoked by the compiled top-level program, excluding built-in
libraries like \scheme{(rnrs)} and \scheme{(chezscheme)}.
The procedure \scheme{library-requirements} may be used to determine
the indirect requirements, i.e., additional libraries required by
the directly invoked libraries.
When combined with \scheme{library-object-filename}, this information can
be used to determine the set of files that must be distributed with the
compiled program file.

A program invokes a library only if it references one or more variables
exported from the library.
The set of libraries invoked by a top-level program, and hence
loaded when the program is loaded, might be smaller than the set
imported by the program, and it might be larger than the set
directly imported by the program.

As with source-code top-level programs, compiled top-level programs may be
run with the
\index{\scheme{--program} command-line option}\scheme{--program}

These procedures are like their non-\scheme{maybe} counterparts but
compile the source file only if the object file is out-of-date.
An object file \var{X} is considered out-of-date if it does not exist or
if it is older than the source file or any files included (via \scheme{include})
when \var{X} was created.
When the value of the parameter \scheme{compile-imported-libraries}

file for any library imported when \var{X} was compiled is out-of-date.
If \scheme{maybe-compile-file} determines that compilation is necessary,
it compiles the source file by passing \scheme{compile-file} the

\returns a list of libraries left to be loaded at run time
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\scheme{compile-whole-program} accepts as input a filename naming
a ``whole program optimization'' (wpo) file for a top-level program
and produces an object file incorporating the program and each
library upon which it depends, provided that a wpo file for the
library can be found.

If a wpo file for a required library cannot be found, but an object
file for the library can, the library is not incorporated in the
resulting object file.
Such libraries are left to be loaded at run time.
\scheme{compile-whole-program} returns a list of such libraries.
If there are no such libraries, the resulting object file is
self-contained and \scheme{compile-whole-program} returns the empty
list.

The libraries incorporated into the resulting object file are visible (for
use by \scheme{environment} and \scheme{eval}) if the \var{libs-visible?}
argument is supplied and non-false.
Any library incorporated into the resulting object file and required by
an object file left to be loaded at run time is also visible, as are any
libraries the object file depends upon, regardless of the value of
\var{libs-visible?}.

\scheme{compile-whole-program} linearizes the initialization code for the
set of incorporated libraries in a way that respects static
dependencies among the libraries but not necessary dynamic dependencies
deriving from initialization-time uses of \scheme{environment}
or \scheme{eval}.
Additional static dependencies can be added in most cases to force
an ordering that allows the dynamic imports to succeed,
though not in general since a different order might be required each
time the program is run.
Adding a static dependency of one library on a second requires
adding an import of the second in the first as well as a run-time
reference to one of the variables exported by the second in the
body of the first.

\var{input-filename} and \var{output-filename} must be strings.
\var{input-filename} must identify a wpo file, and a wpo or object
file must also be present for each required library somewhere in
the directories specified by the \scheme{library-directories}
parameter.

To the extent possible given the specified set of visible libraries
and requirements of libraries to be loaded at run time,
\scheme{compile-whole-program} discards unused code and optimizes
across program and library boundaries, potentially reducing program
load time, run time, and memory requirements.
Some optimization also occurs even across the boundaries of libraries
that are not incorporated into the output, though this optimization
is limited in nature.

\index{\scheme{generate-wpo-files}}%
The procedures \scheme{compile-file}, \scheme{compile-program}, \scheme{compile-library},
\scheme{compile-script}, and \scheme{compile-whole-library} produce wpo files as well as ordinary
object files when the \scheme{generate-wpo-files} parameter is set
to \scheme{#t} (the default is \scheme{#f}).
\scheme{compile-port} and \scheme{compile-to-port} do so when passed
an optional wpo port.

Visit code is the code for macro transformers and meta definitions
required to compile (but not run) dependent libraries.

On most platforms, the input and output paths can be the same,
in which case the input file is replaced with a new file containing
the stripped object code.
Using the same path will likely fail on Windows file systems,

Strip source annotations, which typically appear only on syntax objects,
e.g., identifiers, in the templates of macro transformers.

\item[\scheme{profile-source}:]
Strip source file and character position information from profiled
code objects.
This does not remove the profile counters or eliminate the overhead
for incrementing them at run time.

\item[\scheme{compile-time-information}: ]
This strips compile-time information from compiled libraries, potentially
reducing the size of the resulting file but making it impossible to
use the file to compile dependent code.
This option is useful for creating smaller object files to ship

\formdef{eval-when}{\categorysyntax}{(eval-when \var{situations} \var{form_1} \var{form_2} \dots)}
\returns see below
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\var{situations} must be a list containing some combination of the symbols
\scheme{eval}, \scheme{compile}, \scheme{load}, \scheme{visit}, and
\scheme{revisit}.

When source files are loaded (see \scheme{load}), the forms in the file
are read, compiled, and executed sequentially, so that each form in
the file is fully evaluated before the next one is read.
When a source file is compiled (see \scheme{compile-file}), however, the
forms are read and compiled, \emph{but not executed}, in sequence.
This distinction matters only when the execution of one
form in the file affects the compilation of later forms, e.g.,
when the form results in the definition of a module or syntactic form or
sets a compilation parameter such as \scheme{optimize-level} or
\scheme{case-sensitive}.

For example, assume that a file contains the following two forms:

\schemedisplay
(define-syntax reverse-define
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(_ e x) (define x e)]))

(reverse-define 3 three)
\endschemedisplay

Loading this from source has the effect of defining
\scheme{reverse-define} as a syntactic form and binding the identifier
\scheme{three} to 3.
The situation may be different if the file is compiled with
\scheme{compile-file}, however.
Unless the system or programmer takes steps to assure that the first
form is fully executed before the second expression is compiled,
the syntax expander will not recognize \scheme{reverse-define} as a syntactic
form and will generate code for a procedure call to \scheme{reverse-define}
instead of generating code to define \scheme{three} to be 3.
When the object file is subsequently loaded, the attempt to reference
either \scheme{reverse-define} or \scheme{three} will fail.

As it happens, when a \scheme{define-syntax}, \scheme{module},
\scheme{import}, or \scheme{import-only} form appears at top level, as in the
example above, the compiler does indeed arrange to evaluate it before
going on to compile the remainder of the file.
If the compiler encounters a variable definition for an identifier that
was previously something else, it records that fact as well.
The compiler also generates the
appropriate code so that the bindings will be present as well when
the object file is subsequently loaded.
This solves most, but not all, problems of this nature, since most are
related to the use of \scheme{define-syntax} and modules.
Some problems are not so straightforwardly handled, however.
For example, assume that the file contains the following definitions
for \index{\scheme{nodups?}}\scheme{nodups?} and \index{\scheme{mvlet}}\scheme{mvlet}.

\schemedisplay
(define nodups?
  (lambda (ids)
    (define bound-id-member?
      (lambda (id ids)
        (and (not (null? ids))
             (or (bound-identifier=? id (car ids))
                 (bound-id-member? id (cdr ids))))))
    (or (null? ids)
        (and (not (bound-id-member? (car ids) (cdr ids)))
             (nodups? (cdr ids))))))

(define-syntax mvlet
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_ ((x ...) expr) b1 b2 ...)
       (and (andmap identifier? #'(x ...))
            (nodups? #'(x ...)))
       #'(call-with-values
           (lambda () expr)
           (lambda (x ...) b1 b2 ...))])))

(mvlet ((a b c) (values 1 2 3))
  (list (* a a) (* b b) (* c c)))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
When loaded directly, this results in the definition of
\scheme{nodups?} as a procedure and \scheme{mvlet} as a syntactic
abstraction before evaluation of the \scheme{mvlet} expression.
Because \scheme{nodups?} is defined before the \scheme{mvlet}
expression is expanded, the call to \scheme{nodups?} during the
expansion of \scheme{mvlet} causes no difficulty.
If instead this file were compiled, using \scheme{compile-file}, the
compiler would arrange to define \scheme{mvlet} before continuing
with the expansion and evaluation of the \scheme{mvlet} expression,
but it would not arrange to define \scheme{nodups?}.
Thus the expansion of the \scheme{mvlet} expression would fail.

In this case it does not help to evaluate the syntactic extension alone.
A solution in this case would be to move the definition of
\scheme{nodups?} inside the definition for \scheme{mvlet}, just as
the definition for \scheme{bound-id-member?} is placed within
\scheme{nodups?}, but this does not work for help routines shared
among several syntactic definitions.
Another solution is to label the \scheme{nodups?} definition a
``meta'' definition (see Section~\ref{SECTSYNTAXMETA}) but this
does not work for helpers that are used both by syntactic
abstractions and by run-time code.

A somewhat simpler problem occurs when setting parameters that affect
compilation, such as \scheme{optimize-level} and
\scheme{case-sensitive?}.
If not set prior to compilation, their settings usually will not have
the desired effect.

\scheme{eval-when} offers a solution to these problems by allowing the
programmer to explicitly control what forms should or should not
be evaluated during compilation.
\scheme{eval-when} is a syntactic form and is handled directly by the
expander.
The action of \scheme{eval-when} depends upon the \var{situations} argument
and whether or not the forms \scheme{\var{form_1} \var{form_2} \dots}
are being compiled via \scheme{compile-file} or are being evaluated
directly.
Let's consider each of the possible situation specifiers
\scheme{eval}, \scheme{compile}, \scheme{load}, \scheme{visit}, and
\scheme{revisit} in turn.

\begin{description}
\item[\scheme{eval}:]
The \scheme{eval} specifier is relevant only when the \scheme{eval-when}
form is being
evaluated directly, i.e., if it is typed at the keyboard or loaded from a
source file.
Its presence causes \scheme{\var{form_1} \var{form_2} \dots} to be
expanded and this expansion to be included in the expansion of the
\scheme{eval-when} form.
Thus, the forms will be evaluated directly as if not contained within an
\scheme{eval-when} form.

\item[\scheme{compile}:]
The \scheme{compile} specifier is relevant only when the \scheme{eval-when}
form appears in a file currently being compiled.
(Its presence is simply ignored otherwise.)
Its presence forces \scheme{\var{form_1} \var{form_2} \dots} to be
expanded and evaluated immediately.

\item[\scheme{load}:]
The \scheme{load} specifier is also relevant only when the \scheme{eval-when}
form appears
in a file currently being compiled.
Its presence causes \scheme{\var{form_1} \var{form_2} \dots} to be
expanded and this expansion to be included in the expansion of the
\scheme{eval-when} form.
Any code necessary to record binding information and evaluate syntax
transformers for definitions contained in the forms is marked for
execution when the file is ``visited,'' and any code necessary to
compute the values of variable definitions and the expressions contained
within the forms is marked for execution when the file is ``revisited.''

\item[\scheme{visit}:]
The \scheme{visit} specifier is also relevant only when the \scheme{eval-when}
form appears
in a file currently being compiled.
Its presence causes \scheme{\var{form_1} \var{form_2} \dots} to be
expanded and this expansion to be included in the expansion of the
\scheme{eval-when} form, with an annotation that the forms are to be
executed when the file is ``visited.''

\item[\scheme{revisit}:]
The \scheme{revisit} specifier is also relevant only when the \scheme{eval-when}
form appears
in a file currently being compiled.
Its presence causes \scheme{\var{form_1} \var{form_2} \dots} to be
expanded and this expansion to be included in the expansion of the
\scheme{eval-when} form, with an annotation that the forms are to be
executed when the file is ``revisited.''
\end{description}

\noindent
A file is considered ``visited'' when it is brought in by either
\scheme{load} or \scheme{visit} and ``revisited'' when it is brought in
by either \scheme{load} or \scheme{revisit}.

Top-level expressions are treated as if they are wrapped in an
\scheme{eval-when} with situations \scheme{load} and \scheme{eval}.
This means that, by default, forms typed at the keyboard or
loaded from a source file are evaluated, and forms appearing in a
file to be compiled are not evaluated directly but are compiled for
execution when the resulting object file is subsequently loaded.

The treatment of top-level definitions is slightly more involved.
All definitions result in changes to the compile-time environment.
For example, an identifier defined by \scheme{define} is recorded
as a variable, and an identifier defined by \scheme{define-syntax}
is recorded as a keyword and associated with the value of its
right-hand-side (transformer) expression.
These changes are made at eval, compile, and load
time as if the definitions were wrapped in an \scheme{eval-when} with
situations \scheme{eval}, \scheme{load}, and \scheme{compile}.
(This behavior can be altered by changing the value of the
parameter \scheme{eval-syntax-expanders-when}.)
Some definitions also result in changes to the run-time environment.
For example, a variable is associated with the value of its
right-hand-side expression.
These changes are made just at evaluation and load time as if the
definitions were wrapped in an \scheme{eval-when} with situations
\scheme{eval} and \scheme{load}.

The treatment of local expressions or definitions (those not at top level)
that are wrapped in an \scheme{eval-when} depends only upon whether the
situation \scheme{eval} is present in the list of situations.
If the situation \scheme{eval} is present, the definitions and expressions
are evaluated as if they were not wrapped in an \scheme{eval-when} form,
i.e., the \scheme{eval-when} form is treated as a \scheme{begin} form.
If the situation \scheme{eval} is not present, the forms are ignored;
in a definition context, the \scheme{eval-when} form is treated as an
empty \scheme{begin}, and in an expression context, the \scheme{eval-when}
form is treated as a constant with an unspecified value.

Since top-level syntax bindings are established, by default, at compile
time as well as eval and load time, top-level variable bindings needed
by syntax transformers should be wrapped in an \scheme{eval-when} form
with situations \scheme{compile}, \scheme{load}, and \scheme{eval}.
We can thus \scheme{nodups?} problem above by enclosing the definition
of \scheme{nodups?} in an \scheme{eval-when} as follows.

\schemedisplay
(eval-when (compile load eval)
  (define nodups?
    (lambda (ids)
      (define bound-id-member?
        (lambda (id ids)
          (and (not (null? ids))
               (or (bound-identifier=? id (car ids))
                   (bound-id-member? id (cdr ids))))))
      (or (null? ids)
          (and (not (bound-id-member? (car ids) (cdr ids)))
               (nodups? (cdr ids)))))))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
This forces it to be evaluated before it is needed during the expansion
of the \scheme{mvlet} expression.

Just as it is useful to add \scheme{compile} to the default
\scheme{load} and \scheme{eval} situations, omitting options is also
useful.
Omitting one or more of \scheme{compile}, \scheme{load}, and
\scheme{eval} has the effect of preventing the evaluation at the given
time.
Omitting all of the options has the effect of inhibiting evaluation
altogether.

One common combination of situations is \scheme{(compile eval)}, which by the
inclusion of \scheme{compile} causes the expression to be evaluated at
compile time, and by the omission of \scheme{load} inhibits the generation
of code by the compiler for execution when the file is subsequently loaded.
This is typically used for the definition of syntactic extensions used only
within the file in which they appear; in this case their presence in the
object file is not necessary.
It is also used to set compilation parameters that are intended to be in
effect whether the file is loaded from source or compiled via
\scheme{compile-file}

\schemedisplay
(eval-when (compile eval) (case-sensitive #t))
\endschemedisplay

Another common situations list is \scheme{(compile)}, which might be
used to set compilation options to be used only when the file is
compiled via \scheme{compile-file}.

\schemedisplay
(eval-when (compile) (optimize-level 3))
\endschemedisplay

Finally, one other common combination is \scheme{(load eval)}, which might
be useful for inhibiting the double evaluation (during the compilation of
a file and again when the resulting object file is loaded) of syntax
definitions when the syntactic extensions are not needed within
the file in which their definitions appear.

The behavior of \scheme{eval-when} is usually intuitive but can be
understood precisely as follows.
The \scheme{syntax-case} expander, which handles \scheme{eval-when}
forms, maintains two state sets, one for compile-time forms and
one for run-time forms.
The set of possible states in each set are ``L'' for \scheme{load},
``C'' for \scheme{compile}, ``V'' for \scheme{visit}, ``R'' for
\scheme{revisit}, and ``E'' for \scheme{eval}.

When compiling a file, the compile-time set initially contains ``L''
and ``C'' and the run-time set initially contains only ``L.''
When not compiling a file (as when a form is evaluated by the
read-eval-print loop or loaded from a source file), both sets
initially contain only ``E.''
The subforms of an \scheme{eval-when} form at top level are expanded with
new compile- and run-time sets determined by the current sets and
the situations listed in the \scheme{eval-when} form.
Each element of the current set contributes zero or more elements to the
new set depending upon the given situations according to the following
table.

\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
  & \scheme{load}~ & ~\scheme{compile}~ & ~\scheme{visit}~ & ~\scheme{revisit}~ & ~\scheme{eval}\\
L &  L  &  C  &  V  &  R  & --- \\
C & --- & --- & --- & --- &  C  \\
V &  V  &  C  &  V  & --- & --- \\
R &  R  &  C  & --- &  R  & --- \\
E & --- & --- & --- & --- &  E  \\
\end{tabular}

For example, if the current compile-time state set is \{L\}
and the situations are \scheme{load} and \scheme{compile}, the new compile-time
state set is \{L,~C\}, since L/\scheme{load}
contributes ``L'' and L/\scheme{compile} contributes ``C.''

The state sets determine how forms are treated by the expander.
Compile-time forms such as syntax definitions are evaluated at a time
or times determined by the compile-time state set, and run-time forms
are evaluated at a time or times determined by the run-time state set.
A form is evaluated immediately if ``C'' is in the state set.
Code is generated to evaluate the form at visit or revisit
time if ``V'' or ``R'' is present.
If ``L'' is present in the compile-time set, it is treated as ``V;''
likewise, if ``L'' is present in the run-time set, it is treated as
``R.''
If more than one of states is present in the state set, the
form is evaluated at each specified time.

``E'' can appear in the state set only when not compiling a file, i.e.,
when the expander is invoked from an evaluator such as \scheme{compile}
or \scheme{interpret}.
When it does appear, the expanded form is returned from the expander to be
processed by the evaluator, e.g., \scheme{compile} or \scheme{interpret},
that invoked the expander.

The value of the parameter \scheme{eval-syntax-expanders-when} actually determines
the initial compile-time state set.
The parameter is bound to a list of situations, which defaults to
\scheme{(compile load eval)}.
When compiling a file, \scheme{compile} contributes ``C'' to the
state set, \scheme{load} contributes ``L,'' \scheme{visit} contributes
``V,'' \scheme{revisit} contributes ``R,'' and \scheme{eval}
contributes nothing.
When not compiling a file, \scheme{eval} contributes ``E'' to the
state set, and the other situations contribute nothing.
There is no corresponding parameter for controlling the initial value
of the run-time state set.

\label{eval-when-tlp}%
For RNRS top-level programs, \scheme{eval-when} is essentially ineffective.
The entire program is treated as a single expression, so \scheme{eval-when}
becomes a local \scheme{eval-when} for which only the \scheme{eval}
situation has any relevance.
As for any local \scheme{eval-when} form, the subforms are ignored if
the \scheme{eval} situation is not present; otherwise, they are treated as
if the \scheme{eval-when} wrapper were absent.

This parameter must be set to a list representing a set of
\scheme{eval-when} situations, e.g., a list containing at most one
occurrence of each of the symbols \scheme{eval}, \scheme{compile},
\scheme{load}, \scheme{visit}, and \scheme{revisit}.
It is used to determine the evaluation time of syntax
definitions, module forms, and import forms are expanded.
(See the discussion of \scheme{eval-when} above.)
The default value is \scheme{(compile load eval)}, which causes
compile-time information in a file to be established when the file is
loaded from source, when it is compiled via \scheme{compile-file},
and when a compiled version of the file is loaded via \scheme{load}
or \scheme{visit}.

\section{Source Directories and Files\label{SECTSYSTEMSOURCE}}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{source-directories}{\categoryglobalparameter}{source-directories}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
The value of \scheme{source-directories} must be a list of strings, each
of which names a directory path.
\scheme{source-directories} determines the set of directories searched
for source or object files when a file is loaded via \scheme{load}, \scheme{load-library},
\scheme{load-program}, \scheme{include},
\scheme{visit}, or \scheme{revisit},
when a syntax error occurs, or when a source
file is opened in the interactive inspector.

The default value is the list \scheme{(".")}, which means source files
will be found only in or relative to the current directory, unless named
with an absolute path.

This parameter is never altered by the system, with one exception.
The expander temporarily adds (via \scheme{parameterize}) the directory
in which a library file resides to the front of the \scheme{source-directories}
list when it compiles (when \scheme{compile-imported-libraries} is true) or loads the library from source, which it does
only if the library is not already defined.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{with-source-path}{\categoryprocedure}{(with-source-path \var{who} \var{name} \var{procedure})}

\noindent
The procedure \scheme{with-source-path} searches through the current
source-directories path, in order, for a file with the specified
\var{name} and invokes \var{procedure} on the result.
If no such file is found, an exception is raised with condition types
\scheme{&assertion} and \scheme{&who} with \var{who} as
who value.

If \var{name} is an absolute pathname or one beginning with \scheme{./}
(or \scheme{.\} under Windows) or \scheme{../} (or \scheme{..\} under
Windows), or if the list of source directories
contains only \scheme{"."}, the default, or \scheme{""}, which is
equivalent to \scheme{"."}, no searching is performed and \var{name} is
returned.

\var{who} must be a symbol, \var{name} must be a string, and
\var{procedure} should accept one argument.

The following examples assumes that the file ``pie'' exists
in the directory ``../spam'' but not in ``../ham'' or the current
directory.

\section{Compiler Controls\label{SECTMISCOPTIMIZE}}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\noskipentryheader
\formdef{optimize-level}{\categorythreadparameter}{optimize-level}
\listlibraries
\endnoskipentryheader

\noindent
This parameter can take on one of the four values 0, 1, 2, and 3.

In theory, this parameter controls the amount of optimization
performed by the compiler.
In practice, it does so only indirectly, and the only difference
is between optimize level 3, at which the compiler generates
``unsafe'' code, and optimize levels 0--2, at which the compiler
generates ``safe'' code.
Safe code performs full type and bounds checking so that, for example,
an attempt to apply a non-procedure, an attempt to take the car of a
non-pair, or an attempt to reference beyond the end of a vector each
result in an exception being raised.
With unsafe code, the same situations may result in invalid memory
references, corruption of the Scheme heap (which may cause
seemingly unrelated problems later), system crashes, or other undesirable
behaviors.
Unsafe code is typically faster, but optimize-level 3 should be used with
caution and only on sections of well-tested code that must run as quickly
as possible.

While the compiler produces the same code for optimize levels 0--2,
user-defined macro transformers can differentiate among the different
levels if desired.

One way to use optimize levels is on a per-file
basis, using \index{\scheme{eval-when}}\scheme{eval-when} to force the use of a particular
optimize level at compile time.
For example, placing:

\schemedisplay
(eval-when (compile) (optimize-level 3))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
at the front of a file will cause all of the forms in the file to be
compiled at optimize level 3 when the file is compiled (using
\index{\scheme{compile-file}}\scheme{compile-file}) but does not affect the optimize level used
when the file is loaded from source.
Since \scheme{compile-file} parameterizes \scheme{optimize-level} (see \scheme{parameterize}),
the above
expression does not permanently alter the optimize level in the
system in which the \scheme{compile-file} is performed.

The optimize level can also be set via the
\index{\scheme{--optimize-level} command-line option}\scheme{--optimize-level}
command-line option (Section~\ref{SECTUSECOMMANDLINE}).
This option is particularly useful for running RNRS top-level programs
at optimize-level~3 via the
\index{\scheme{--program} command-line option}\scheme{--program} command-line option,
since \scheme{eval-when} is ineffective for RNRS top-level programs as described
on page~\pageref{eval-when-tlp}.

\noindent
\var{variable} must name a primitive procedure.
The \scheme{$primitive} syntactic form allows control over the
optimize level at the granularity of individual primitive references,
and it can be used to access the original value
of a primitive, regardless of the lexical context or the current
top-level binding for the variable originally bound to the primitive.

The expression \scheme{($primitive \var{variable})} may
be abbreviated as \scheme{#%\var{variable}}.
The reader expands \scheme{#%} followed by an object
into a \scheme{$primitive} expression, much as it expands \scheme{'\var{object}}
into a \scheme{quote} expression.

If a \scheme{2} or \scheme{3} appears in the form or between the
\scheme{#} and \scheme{%} in the abbreviated form, the compiler treats
an application of the primitive as if it were compiled
at the corresponding optimize level (see the \scheme{optimize-level}
parameter).
If no number appears in the form, an application of the primitive is
treated as an optimize-level 3 application if the current optimize
level is 3;
otherwise, it is treated as an optimize-level 2 application.

\noindent
This parameter can take on one of the four values 0, 1, 2, and 3.
It is used to tell the compiler how important the preservation of
debugging information is, with 0 being least important and 3 being
most important.
The default value is 1.
As of Version~9.0, it is used solely to determine whether an
error-causing call encountered in nontail position is treated as
if it were in tail position (thus causing the caller's frame not
to appear in a stack backtrace); this occurs at debug levels below~2.

\entryheader
\formdef{generate-interrupt-trap}{\categorythreadparameter}{generate-interrupt-trap}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
To support interrupts, including keyboard, timer, and collect request
interrupts, the compiler inserts a short sequence of instructions at the
entry to each nonleaf procedure (Section~\ref{SECTSYSTEMINTERRUPTS}).
This small overhead may be eliminated by setting
\scheme{generate-interrupt-trap} to \scheme{#f}.
The default value of this parameter is \scheme{#t}.

It is rarely a good idea to compile code without interrupt trap
generation, since a tight loop in the generated code may completely
prevent interrupts from being serviced, including the collect request
interrupt that causes garbage collections to occur automatically.
Disabling trap generation may be useful, however, for routines that act
simply as ``wrappers'' for other routines for which code is presumably
generated with interrupt trap generation enabled.
It may also be useful for short performance-critical routines with
embedded loops or recursions that are known to be short running and
that make no other calls.

\noindent
At all optimize levels, when the value of
\scheme{compile-interpret-simple} is set to a true value (the default),
\index{\scheme{compile}}\scheme{compile} interprets simple
expressions.
A simple expression is one that creates no procedures.
This can save a significant amount of time over the course of many
calls to \scheme{compile} or \scheme{eval} (with \scheme{current-eval}
set to \scheme{compile}, its default value).
When set to false, \scheme{compile} compiles all expressions.

\entryheader\label{desc:generate-inspector-information}
\formdef{generate-inspector-information}{\categorythreadparameter}{generate-inspector-information}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
When this parameter is set to a true value (the default), information
about the source and contents of procedures and continuations is
generated during compilation and retained in tables associated with
each code segment.
This information allows the inspector to provide more complete
information, at the expense of using more memory and producing
larger object files (via \scheme{compile-file}).
Although compilation and loading may be slower when inspector
information is generated, the speed of the compiled code is not
affected.
If this parameter is changed during the compilation of a file, the
original value will be restored.
For example, if:

\schemedisplay
(eval-when (compile) (generate-inspector-information #f))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
is included in a file, generation of inspector information will be
disabled only for the remainder of that particular file.

\formdef{generate-procedure-source-information}{\categorythreadparameter}{generate-procedure-source-information}

\noindent
When \scheme{generate-inspector-information} is set to \scheme{#f} and
this parameter is set to \scheme{#t}, then a source location is preserved
for a procedure, even though other inspector information is not preserved.
Source information provides a small amount of debugging support at a
much lower cost in memory and object-file size than full inspector information.
If this parameter is changed during the compilation of a file, the
original value will be restored.

\formdef{enable-cross-library-optimization}{\categorythreadparameter}{enable-cross-library-optimization}

This parameter controls whether information is included with the
object code for a compiled library to enable propagation of constants
and inlining of procedures defined in the library into dependent
libraries.
When set to \scheme{#t} (the default), this information is included;
when set to \scheme{#f}, the information is not included.
Setting the parameter to \scheme{#f} potentially reduces the sizes
of the resulting object files and the exposure of near-source
information via the object file.

\scheme{compile-file}, \scheme{compile-library}, \scheme{compile-program},

files for use by \scheme{compile-whole-program}.
The name of the \scheme{wpo} file is derived from the output-file
name by replacing the object-file extension (normally \scheme{.so})
with \scheme{.wpo}, or adding the extension \scheme{.wpo} if the
object filename has no extension or has the extension \scheme{.wpo}.

\formdef{cp0-outer-unroll-limit}{\categorythreadparameter}{cp0-outer-unroll-limit}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
These parameters control the operation of \scheme{cp0}, a source
optimization pass that runs after macro expansion and prior
to most other compiler passes.
\scheme{cp0} performs procedure inlining, in which the code of one
procedure is inlined at points where it is called by other procedures,
as well as copy propagation, constant folding, useless code
elimination, and several related optimizations.
The algorithm used by the optimizer is described in detail in the paper
``Fast and effective procedure inlining''~\cite{waddell:sas97}.

When \scheme{cp0} is enabled, the programmer can count on the compiler
to fold constants, eliminate unnecessary \scheme{let} bindings, and
eliminate unnecessary and inaccessible code.
This is particularly useful when writing macros, since the programmer
can usually handle only the general case and let the compiler simplify
the code when possible.
For example, the programmer can define \scheme{case} as follows:

\schemedisplay
(define-syntax case
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(_ e [(k ...) a1 a2 ...] ... [else b1 b2 ...])
     (let ([t e])
       (cond
         [(memv t '(k ...)) a1 a2 ...]
         ...
         [else b1 b2 ...]))]
    [(_ e [(k ...) a1 a2 ...] ...)
     (let ([t e])
       (cond
         [(memv t '(k ...)) a1 a2 ...]
         ...))]))
\endschemedisplay

and count on the introduce \scheme{let} expression to be eliminated
if \scheme{e} turns out to be an unassigned variable, and count on
the entire \scheme{case} expression to be folded if \scheme{e} turns
out to be a constant.

It is possible to see what \scheme{cp0} does with an expression
via the procedure \index{\scheme{expand/optimize}}\scheme{expand/optimize},
which expands its argument and passes the result through \scheme{cp0}, as
illustrated by the following transcript.

\schemedisplay
> (print-gensym #f)
> (expand/optimize
    '(lambda (x)
       (case x [(a) 1] [(b c) 2] [(d) 3] [else 4])))
(lambda (x)
  (if (#2%memv x '(a))
      1
      (if (#2%memv x '(b c)) 2 (if (#2%memv x '(d)) 3 4))))
> (expand/optimize
    '(+ (let ([f (lambda (x)
                (case x [(a) 1] [(b c) 2] [(d) 3] [else 4]))])
          (f 'b))
         15))
17
\endschemedisplay

In the first example, the \scheme{let} expression produced by \scheme{case}
is eliminated, and in the second, the entire expression is optimized down
to the constant \scheme{17}.
Although not shown by \scheme{expand/optimize}, the \scheme{memv} calls
in the output code for the first example will be replaced by calls to the
less expensive \scheme{eq?} by a later pass of the compiler.
Additional examples are given in the description
of \scheme{expand/optimize}.

The value of \scheme{run-cp0} must be a procedure.
Whenever the compiler is invoked on a Scheme form, the value \var{p}
of this parameter is called to determine whether and how
\scheme{cp0} is run.
\var{p} receives two arguments: \var{cp0}, the entry point into
\scheme{cp0}, and \var{x}, the form being compiled.
The default value of \scheme{run-cp0} simply invokes \var{cp0} on
\var{x}, then \var{cp0} again on the result.
The second run is useful in some cases because the first run
may not eliminate bindings for certain variables that appear to be
referenced but are not actually referenced after inlining.
The marginal benefit of the second run is usually minimal, but so is the
cost.

\noindent
Interesting variants include

\schemedisplay
(run-cp0 (lambda (cp0 x) x))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
which bypasses (disables) \scheme{cp0}, and

\schemedisplay
(run-cp0 (lambda (cp0 x) (cp0 x)))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
which runs \scheme{cp0} just once.

The value of \scheme{cp0-effort-limit} determines the maximum amount
of effort spent on each inlining attempt.
The time spent optimizing a program is a linear function of this limit and the
number of calls in the program's source, so small values for this parameter
enforce a tighter bound on compile time.
When set to zero, inlining is disabled except when the name of a procedure
is referenced only once.
The value of \scheme{cp0-score-limit} determines the maximum amount of
code produced per inlining attempt.
Small values for this parameter limit the amount of overall code expansion.
These parameters must be set to nonnegative fixnum values.

The parameter \scheme{cp0-outer-unroll-limit}
controls the amount of inlining performed by the optimizer for
recursive procedures.
With the parameter's value set to the default value of \scheme{0}, recursive
procedures are not inlined.
A nonzero value for the outer unroll limit allows calls external to
a recursive procedure to be inlined.
For example, the expression

\schemedisplay
(letrec ([fact (lambda (x) (if (zero? x) 1 (* x (fact (- x 1)))))])
  (fact 10))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
would be left unchanged with the outer unroll limit set to zero, but would
be converted into

\schemedisplay
(letrec ([fact (lambda (x) (if (zero? x) 1 (* x (fact (- x 1)))))])
  (* 10 (fact 9)))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
with the outer unroll limit set to one.

Interesting effects can be had by varying several of these parameters at
once.
For example, setting the
effort and outer unroll limits to large values and the score limit
to \scheme{1} has the effect of inlining even complex recursive procedures
whose values turn out to be constant at compile time without risking
any code expansion.
For example,

\schemedisplay
(letrec ([fact (lambda (x) (if (zero? x) 1 (* x (fact (- x 1)))))])
  (fact 10))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
would be reduced to \scheme{3628800}, but

\schemedisplay
(letrec ([fact (lambda (x) (if (zero? x) 1 (* x (fact (- x 1)))))])
  (fact z))
\endschemedisplay

\noindent
would be left unchanged, although the optimizer may take a while to
reach this decision if the effort and outer unroll limits are large.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{commonization-level}{\categorythreadparameter}{commonization-level}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

After running the main source optimization pass (cp0) for the last time, the
compiler optionally runs a \emph{commonization} pass.
The pass commonizes the code for lambda expressions that have
identical structure by abstracting differences at certain leaves
of the program, namely constants, references to unassigned variables,
and references to primitives.
The parameter \scheme{commonization-level} controls whether commonization
is run and, if so, how aggressive it is.
Its value must be a nonnegative exact integer ranging from 0 through 9.
When the parameter is set to 0, the default, commonization is not run.
Otherwise, higher values result in more commonization.

Commonization can undo some of the effects of cp0's inlining, can
add run-time overhead, and can complicate debugging, particularly
at higher commonization levels, which is why it is disabled by
default.
On the other hand, for macros or other meta programs that can
generate large, mostly similar lambda expressions, enabling
commonization can result in significant savings in object-code size
and even reduce run-time overhead by making more efficient use of
instruction caches.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{undefined-variable-warnings}{\categorythreadparameter}{undefined-variable-warnings}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

When \scheme{undefined-variable-warnings} is set to \scheme{#t}, the
compiler issues a warning message whenever it cannot determine that
a variable bound by \scheme{letrec}, \scheme{letrec*}, or an internal
definition will not be referenced before it is defined.
The default value is \scheme{#f}.

Regardless of the setting of this parameter, the compiler inserts code
to check for the error, except at optimize level 3.
The check is fairly inexpensive and does not typically inhibit inlining
or other optimizations.
In code that must be carefully tuned, however, it is sometimes useful
to reorder bindings or make other changes to eliminate the checks.
Enabling undefined-variable warnings can facilitate this process.

The checks are also visible in the output of \scheme{expand/optimize}.

The parameters \scheme{expand-output} and \scheme{expand/optimize-output}
can be used to request that the compiler and interpreter print
expander and source-optimizer output produced during the compilation or
interpretation process.
Each parameter must be set to either \scheme{#f} (the default) or a
textual output port.

When \scheme{expand-output} is set to a textual output port, the output
of the expander is printed to the port as a side effect of running
\scheme{compile}, \scheme{interpret}, or any of the file compiling
primitives, e.g., \scheme{compile-file} or \scheme{compile-library}.
Similarly, when \scheme{expand/optimize-output} is set to a textual
output port, the output of the source optimizer is printed.

\index{\scheme{expand}}\index{\scheme{expand/optimize}}%
See also \scheme{expand} (page~\pageref{desc:expand}) and
\scheme{expand-optimize} (page~\pageref{desc:expand/optimize}), which
can be used to run the expander or the expander and source optimizer
directly on an individual form.

\formdef{pariah}{\categorysyntax}{(pariah \var{expr_1} \var{expr_2} \dots)}
\returns the values of the last subexpression
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

A \scheme{pariah} expression is just like a \scheme{begin} expression
except that it informs the compiler that the code is expected to
be executed infrequently.
The compiler uses this information to optimize code layout, register
assignments, and other aspects of the generated code.
The \scheme{pariah} form can be used in performance-critical code
to mark the branches of a conditional (e.g., \scheme{if}, \scheme{cond},
or \scheme{case}) that are less likely to be executed than the
others.


\section{Profiling\label{SECTMISCPROFILE}}

\index{profiling}\index{block profiling}\index{source profiling}%
{ChezScheme} supports two forms of profiling: source profiling and
block profiling.
With source profiling enabled, the compiler instruments the code
it produces to count the number of times each source-code expression
is executed.
This information can be
displayed in HTML format, or it can be packaged in a list or
source table for arbitrary user-defined processing.
It can also be dumped to a file to be loaded subsequently into the
compiler's database of profile information for use in source-level
optimizations, such as reordering the clauses of a \scheme{case}
or \scheme{exclusive-cond} form.
In connection with coverage-information (covin) files generated by the
compiler when
\index{\scheme{generate-covin-files}}\scheme{generate-covin-files}
is \scheme{#t}, profile information can also be used to gauge coverage
of a source-code base by a set of tests.

The association between source-code expressions and profile counts
is usually established via annotations produced by the reader and
present in the input to the expander (Section~\ref{SECTSYNTAXANNOTATIONS}).
It is also possible to explicitly identify source positions
to be assigned profile counts via \scheme{profile} expressions.
A \scheme{profile} expression has one subform, a source object, and
returns an unspecified value.
Its only effect is to cause the number of times the expression is
executed to be accounted to the source object.

In cases where source positions explicitly identified by \scheme{profile}
forms are the only ones whose execution counts should be tracked,
the parameter \scheme{generate-profile-forms} can be set to \scheme{#f}
to inhibit the expander's implicit generation of \scheme{profile} forms
for all annotated source expressions.
It is also possible to obtain finer control over implicit generation of
\scheme{profile} forms by marking which annotations that should and
should not be used for profiling (Section~\ref{SECTSYNTAXANNOTATIONS}).

With block profiling enabled, the compiler similarly instruments the
code it produces to count the number of times each ``basic block''
in the code it produces is executed.
Basic blocks are the building blocks of the code produced by many
compilers, including {\ChezScheme}'s compiler, and are sequences
of straight-line code entered only at the top and exited only at
the bottom.
Counting the number of times each basic block is executed is
equivalent to counting the number of times each instruction is
executed, but more efficient.
Block-profile information cannot be viewed, but it can be dumped
to a file to be loaded subsequently into the compiler's database of
profile information for use in block- and instruction-level
optimizations.
These optimizations include reordering blocks to push less frequently
used sequences of code out-of-line, so they will not occupy space
in the instruction cache, and giving registers to variables that are
used in more frequently executed instructions.

Source profiling involves at least the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item compile the code with source profiling enabled,
\item run the compiled code to generate source-profile information, and
\item dump the profile information.
\end{itemize}

\index{\scheme{compile-profile}}%
Source profiling is enabled by setting the parameter
\scheme{compile-profile} to the symbol \scheme{source}
or to the boolean value \scheme{#t}.
The profile information can be dumped via:

\begin{description}
\item[\scheme{profile-dump-html}]\index{\scheme{profile-dump-html}}
in HTML format to allow the programmer to visualize how
often each expression is executed using a color-coding system that
makes it easy to spot ``hot spots,''
\item[\scheme{profile-dump-list}]\index{\scheme{profile-dump-list}}
in a form suitable for user-defined post-processing,
\item[\scheme{profile-dump}]\index{\scheme{profile-dump}}
in a form suitable for off-line processing by one of the methods
above or by some custom means, or
\item[\scheme{profile-dump-data}]\index{\scheme{profile-dump-data}}
in a form suitable for loading into the compiler's database.
\end{description}

If the information is intended to be fed back into the compiler for
optimization, the following additional steps are required, either
in the same or a different Scheme process:

\begin{itemize}
\item load the profile information into the compiler's profile
database, and
\item recompile the code.
\end{itemize}

\index{\scheme{profile-load-data}}%
Profile information dumped by \scheme{profile-dump-data} is loaded
into the compiler's profile database via \scheme{profile-load-data}.
Profiling information is \emph{not} available to the compiler unless
it is explicitly dumped via \scheme{profile-dump-data} and loaded
via \scheme{profile-load-data}.

When block-profile information is to be used for optimization,
the steps are similar:

\begin{itemize}
\item compile the code with block profiling enabled,
\item run the code to generate block-profile information,
\item dump the profile information,
\item load the profile information, and
\item recompile the code.
\end{itemize}

\index{\scheme{profile-dump-data}}%
\index{\scheme{profile-load-data}}%
Block profiling is enabled by setting the parameter
\scheme{compile-profile} to the symbol \scheme{block}
or to the boolean value \scheme{#t}.
The profile information must be dumped via \scheme{profile-dump-data}
and loaded via \scheme{profile-load-data}.
As with source profile information, block profile information can be
loaded in the same or in a different Scheme process as the one that
dumped the information.

For block optimization, the code to be recompiled must be identical.
In general, this means the files involved must not have been modified,
and nothing else can change that indirectly affects the code produced
by the compiler, e.g., settings for compiler parameters such as
\scheme{optimize-level} or the contents of configuration files read
by macros at compile time.
Otherwise, the set of blocks or the instructions within them might
be different, in which case the block profile information will not
line up properly and the compiler will raise an exception.

For the same reason, when both source profiling and block profiling
information is to be used for optimization, the source information
must be gathered first and loaded before both the first and second
compilation runs involved in block profiling.
That is, the following steps must be used:

\begin{itemize}
\item[1] compile the code with source profiling enabled,
\item[2] run the code to generate source-profile information,
\item[2] dump the source-profile information,
\item[3] load the source-profile information,
\item[3] recompile the code with block profiling enabled,
\item[4] run the code to generate block-profile information,
\item[4] dump the block-profile information,
\item[5] load the source- and block-profile information, and
\item[5] recompile the code.
\end{itemize}

The numbers labeling each step indicate both the order of the steps
and those that must be performed in the same Scheme process.
(All of the steps can be performed in the same Scheme process, if
desired.)

Both source and block profiling are disabled when \scheme{compile-profile}
is set to \scheme{#f}, its default value.

The following example highlights the use of source profiling for
identifying hot spots in the code.
Let's assume that the file /tmp/fatfib/fatfib.ss contains the
following source code.

\schemedisplay
(define fat+
  (lambda (x y)
    (if (zero? y)
        x
        (fat+ (1+ x) (1- y)))))

(define fatfib
  (lambda (x)
    (if (< x 2)
        1
        (fat+ (fatfib (1- x)) (fatfib (1- (1- x)))))))
\endschemedisplay

We can load fatfib.ss with profiling enabled as follows.

\schemedisplay
(parameterize ([compile-profile 'source])
  (load "/tmp/fatfib/fatfib.ss"))
\endschemedisplay

We then run the application as usual.

\schemedisplay
(fatfib 20) ;=> 10946
\endschemedisplay

After the run (or multiple runs), we
dump the profile information as a set of html files using
\scheme{profile-dump-html}.

\schemedisplay
(profile-dump-html)
\endschemedisplay

This creates a file named profile.html containing a summary of the profile
information gathered during the run.
If we view this file in a browser, we should see something like the
following.

\iflatex
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{canned/profilehtml}
\end{center}
\fi
\ifhtml
\raw{\raw{<img src="canned/profilehtml.png" alt="profile.html listing">}}
\fi

The most frequently executed code is highlighted in colors closer to
red in the visible spectrum, while
the least frequently executed code is highlighted in colors closer to
violet.
Each of the entries in the lists of files and hot spots are links into
additional generated files, one per source file (provided
\scheme{profile-dump-html} was able to locate an unmodified copy of
the source file).
In this case, there is only one, fatfib.ss.html.
If we move to that file, we should see something like this:

\iflatex
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{canned/fatfibhtml}
\end{center}
\fi
\ifhtml
\raw{\raw{<img src="canned/fatfibhtml.png" alt="fatfib.html listing">}}
\fi

As in the summary, the code is color-coded according to frequency
of execution.
Hovering over a color-coded section of code should cause a pop-up
box to appear with the starting position and count of the source
expression.
If a portion of source code is not color-coded or is identified
via the starting position as having inherited its color from some
enclosing expression, it may have been recognized as dead code by
the compiler or garbage collector and discarded, or the expander
might not have been able to track it through the macro-expansion
process.

\scheme{profile-dump} and \scheme{profile-dump-list} may be used to
generate a list of profile entries, which may then be analyzed manually
or via a custom profile-viewing application.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{compile-profile}{\categorythreadparameter}{compile-profile}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

When this parameter is set to the symbol \scheme{source} or the
boolean value \scheme{#t}, the compiler instruments the code it
generates with instructions that count the number of times each
section of source code is executed.
When set to the symbol \scheme{block}, the compiler similarly
instruments the code it generates with instructions that count the
number of times each block of code is executed.
When set to \scheme{#f} (the default), the compiler does not insert
these instructions.

The general description of profiling above describes how the source
and block profile information can be viewed or used for optimization.

The code generated when \scheme{compile-profile} is non-false is
larger and less efficient, so this parameter should be set only
when profile information is needed.

The profile counters for code compiled when profile instrumentation
is enabled are retained indefinitely, even if the code with which
they are associated is reclaimed by the garbage collector.
This results in more complete and accurate profile data but can lead
to space leaks in programs that dynamically generate or load code.
Such programs can avoid the potential space leak by releasing the
counters explicitly via the procedure
\index{\scheme{profile-release-counters}}\scheme{profile-release-counters}.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{generate-covin-files}{\categorythreadparameter}{generate-covin-files}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

When this parameter is set to \scheme{#t}, the compiler generates
``coverage-information'' (covin) files that can be used in connection with
profile information to measure coverage of a source-code base by a
set of tests.
One covin file is created for each object file, with the object-file
extension replaced by the extension \scheme{.covin}.
Each covin file contains the printed representation of a source table
(Section~\ref{SECTSYNTAXSOURCETABLES}), compressed using the compression
format and level specified by \scheme{compress-format} and
\scheme{compress-level}.
This information can be read via
\index{\scheme{get-source-table!}}\scheme{get-source-table!} and used
as a universe of source expressions to identify source expressions
that are not evaluated during the running of a set of tests.


\entryheader
\formdef{profile}{\categorysyntax}{(profile \var{source-object})}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

A \scheme{profile} form has the effect of accounting to the source
position identified by \var{source-object} the number of times the
\scheme{profile} form is executed.
Profile forms are generated implicitly by the expander for source
expressions in annotated input, e.g., input read by the compiler or
interpreter from a Scheme source file, so this form is typically
useful only when unannotated source code is produced by the front
end for some language that targets Scheme.

\entryheader
\formdef{generate-profile-forms}{\categorythreadparameter}{(generate-profile-forms)}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

When this parameter is set to \scheme{#t}, the default, the expander
implicitly introduces \scheme{profile} forms for each annotated input
expression, unless the annotation has not been marked for use in
profiling  (Section~\ref{SECTSYNTAXANNOTATIONS}).
It can be set to \scheme{#f} to inhibit the expander's implicit
generation of \scheme{profile} forms, typically when explicit
\scheme{profile} forms are already present for all source positions
that should be profiled.

\formdef{profile-dump}{\categoryprocedure}{(profile-dump)}
\returns a list of pairs of source-object and count
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

This procedure produces a dump of all
profile information gathered since startup or the last call to
\scheme{profile-clear}.
It returns a list of pairs, where the car of each pair
is a source object (Section~\ref{SECTSYNTAXANNOTATIONS}) and the
cdr is an exact nonnegative integer count.

The list might contain more than one entry per source object due
to macro expansion and procedure inlining, and it might contain
more than one (non-eq) source object per file and source position
due to separate compilation.
In such cases, the counts are not overlapping and can be summed
together to obtain the full count.

The advantage of \scheme{profile-dump} over \scheme{profile-dump-list}
is that \scheme{profile-dump} performs only minimal processing and
preserves complete source objects, including their embedded source-file
descriptors.
It might be used, for example, to dump profile information to a
fasl file on one machine for subsequent processing on another.

\index{\scheme{with-profile-tracker}}\scheme{with-profile-tracker}
can be used to obtain the same set of counts as a source table.

\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\var{thunk} must be a procedure and should accept zero arguments.
It may return any number of values.

\scheme{with-profile-tracker} invokes \var{thunk} without arguments.
If \var{thunk} returns $n$ values \scheme{\var{x_1}, \var{x_2}, \dots, \var{x_n}}, \scheme{with-profile-tracker}
returns $n+1$ values \scheme{\var{st}, \var{x_1}, \var{x_2}, \dots, \var{x_n}}, where \var{st} is a
source table associating source objects with profile counts.
If \var{preserve-existing?} is absent or \scheme{#f}, each count
represents the number of times the source expression represented
by the associated source object is evaluated during the invocation
of \var{thunk}.
Otherwise, each count represents the number of times the source
expression represented by the associated source object is evaluated
before or during the invocation of \var{thunk}.

Profile data otherwise cleared by a call to
\index{\scheme{profile-clear}}\scheme{profile-clear} or
\index{\scheme{profile-release-counters}}\scheme{profile-release-counters}
during the invocation of \var{thunk} is included in the
resulting table.
That is, invoking these procedures while \var{thunk} is running has
no effect on the resulting counts.
On the other hand, profile data cleared before \scheme{with-profile-tracker}
is invoked is not included in the resulting table.

The idiom \scheme{(with-profile-tracker #t values)} can be used to obtain
the current set of profile counts as a source table.

and one file \var{source}.html for each source
file \var{source} containing a color-coded copy of the
source code, as described in the lead-in to this section.
If \var{prefix} is specified, it must be a string and is prepended
to the names of the generated HTML files.
For example, if \var{prefix} is \scheme{"/tmp/"}, the generated
files are placed in the directory /tmp.
The raw profile information is obtained from \var{dump}, which

This value of this parameter must be a nonempty vector of at least
three pairs.
The car of each pair is a background color and the cdr is a foreground
(text) color.
Each color must be a string, and each string should contain an HTML
cascading style sheet (CSS) color specifier.
The first pair is used for unprofiled code, and the second is used
for unexecuted profiled code.
The third is used for code that is executed least frequently, the fourth
for code executed next-least frequently, and so on, with the last
being used for code that is executed most frequently.
Programmers may wish to supply their own palette to enhance visibility
or to change the number of colors used.

By default, a black background is used for unprofiled code, and a gray
background is used for unexecuted profiled code.
Background colors ranging from purple to red are used for executed
profiled code, depending on frequency of execution, with red for the most
frequently executed code.

\returns a list of profile entries (see below)
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

This procedure produces a dump of all
profile information present in \var{dump}, which defaults to
the value returned by \scheme{profile-dump}.
It returns a list of entries, each of which is itself a list containing the
following elements identifying one block of code and how many times it
has been executed.

\begin{itemize}
 \item execution count
 \item pathname
 \item beginning file position in characters (inclusive)
 \item ending file position in characters (exclusive)
 \item line number of beginning file position
 \item character position of beginning file position
\end{itemize}

\scheme{profile-dump-list} may be unable to locate an unmodified copy
of the file in the current source directories
or at the absolute address, if an absolute address was used when
the file was compiled or loaded.
If this happens, the line number and character position of the beginning
file position are \scheme{#f} and the pathname is the pathname originally
used.
A warning is also issued (an exception with condition type
\scheme{&warning} is raised) unless the \scheme{warn?} argument is provided
and is false.

Otherwise, the pathname is the path to an unmodified copy of the source
and the line and character positions are set to exact nonnegative integers.

In either case, the execution count, beginning file position, and ending
file position are all exact nonnegative integers, and the pathname is a string.

For source positions in files that cannot be found, the list might
contain more than one entry per position due to macro expansion,
procedure inlining, and separate compilation.
In such cases, the counts are not overlapping and can be summed
together to obtain the full count.

The information returned by \scheme{profile-dump-list} can be used to
implement a custom viewer or used as input for offline analysis of
profile information.

The advantage of \scheme{profile-dump-list} over \scheme{profile-dump}
is that it attempts to determine the line number and character
position for each source point and, if successful, aggregates
multiple counts for the source point into a single entry.

Each \var{path} must be a string.

This procedure reads profile information from the files named by
\scheme{\var{path} \dots} and stores it in the compiler's internal
database of profile information.
The contents of the files must have been created originally by
\scheme{profile-dump-data} using the same version of {\ChezScheme}.

The database stores a weight for each source expression or block
rather than the actual count.
When a single file is loaded into the database, the weight is the
proportion of the actual count over the maximum count for all
expressions or blocks represented in the file.
When more than one file is loaded, either by one or multiple calls
to \scheme{profile-load-data}, the weights are averaged.

\returns \var{obj}'s profile weight, or \scheme{#f} if \var{obj} is not in the database
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

The compiler's profile database maps source objects
(Section~\ref{SECTSYNTAXANNOTATIONS}) to weights.
If \var{obj} is a source object, the \scheme{profile-query-weight} returns
the weight associated with the source object or \scheme{#f} if the database
does not have a weight recorded for the source object.
\var{obj} can also be an annotation or syntax object, in which case
\scheme{profile-query-weight} first extracts the source object, if any,
using \scheme{syntax->annotation} and \scheme{annotation-source},
returning \scheme{#f} if no source-object is found.

A weight is a flonum in the range 0.0 to 1.0, inclusive, and denotes the
ratio of the actual count to the maximum count as described in the
description of \scheme{profile-load-data}.

\scheme{profile-query-weight} can be used by a macro to determine
the relative frequency with which its subexpressions were executed
in the run or runs that generated the information in the database.
This information can be used to guide the generation of code that
is likely to be more efficient.
For example, the \scheme{case} macro uses profile information, when
available, to order the clauses so that those whose keys matched
more frequently are tested before those whose keys matched less
frequently.

reset and exit handlers (see \scheme{reset-handler} and \scheme{exit-handler}).
Exiting a caf\'e resumes the continuation of the call
to \scheme{new-cafe} that created the caf\'e.
Exiting from the initial caf\'e leaves Scheme altogether.
A caf\'e may be exited from either by an explicit call to \scheme{exit} or
by receipt of end-of-file (``control-D'' on Unix systems) in response
to the waiter's prompt.
In the former case, any values passed to \scheme{exit} are returned from
\scheme{new-cafe}.

If the optional \var{eval-proc} argument is specified, \var{eval-proc}
is used to evaluate forms entered from the console.
Otherwise, the value of the parameter \scheme{current-eval} is used.
\var{eval-proc} must accept one argument, the expression to evaluate.

Interesting values for \var{eval-proc} include \index{\scheme{expand}}\scheme{expand},
which causes the macro expanded value of each expression entered to
be printed and \scheme{(lambda (x) x)}, which simply causes each expression
entered to be printed.
An arbitrary procedure of one argument may be used to facilitate
testing of a program on a series of input values.

The default waiter reader (see \scheme{waiter-prompt-and-read}) displays
the current waiter prompt (see \scheme{waiter-prompt-string})
to the current value of \index{\scheme{console-output-port}}\scheme{console-output-port} and
reads
from the current value of \index{\scheme{console-input-port}}\scheme{console-input-port}.
The default waiter printer (see \scheme{waiter-write}) sends output
to the current value of \index{\scheme{console-output-port}}\scheme{console-output-port}.
These parameters, along with \scheme{current-eval},
can be modified to change the behavior of the waiter.

\section{Times and Dates\label{SECTSYSTEMTIMESNDATES}}

This section documents procedures for handling times and dates.  Most of
the procedures described here are proposed in
\hyperlink{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-19/srfi-19.html}{SRFI~19}:
Time Data Types and Procedures, by Will Fitzgerald.

Times are represented by time objects.
Time objects record the nanosecond and second of a particular time
or duration, along with a \emph{time type} that identifies the nature
of the time object.
The time type is one of the following symbols:

\begin{description}
\item[\scheme{time-utc}:]
The time elapsed since the ``epoch:'' 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970,
subject to adjustment, e.g., to correct for leap seconds.

\item[\scheme{time-monotonic}:]
The time elapsed since some arbitrary point in the past, ideally
not subject to adjustment.

\item[\scheme{time-duration}:]
The time elapsed between two times.
When used as an argument to \scheme{current-time}, it behaves like
\scheme{time-monotonic}, but may also used to represent the result
of subtracting two time objects.

\item[\scheme{time-process}:]
The amount of CPU time used by the current process.

\item[\scheme{time-thread}:]
The amount of CPU time used by the current thread.
It is the same as \scheme{time-process} if
not running threaded or if the system does not allow individual
thread times to be determined.

\item[\scheme{time-collector-cpu}:]
The portion of the current process's CPU time consumed by the
garbage collector.

\item[\scheme{time-collector-real}:]
The portion of the current process's real time consumed by the
garbage collector.
\end{description}

A time-object second is an exact integer (possibly negative),
and a nanosecond is an exact nonnegative integer less than $10^9$.
The second and nanosecond of a time object may be converted to
an aggregate nanosecond value by scaling the
seconds by $10^9$ and adding the nanoseconds.
Thus, if the second and nanosecond of a time object are 5 and 10,
the time object represents 5000000010 nanoseconds (5.000000010 seconds).
If the second and nanosecond are -5 and 10, the time object
represents -4999999990 nanoseconds (-4.999999990 seconds).

Dates are represented by date objects.
A date object records the nanosecond, second, minute, hour, day, month,
and year of a particular date, along with an offset that identifies the
time zone.

As for time objects, a nanosecond is an exact integer less than $10^9$.
A date-object second is, however, an exact nonnegative integer
less than 62.
(The values 61 and 62 allow for leap seconds.)
A minute is an exact nonnegative integer less than 60, and
an hour is an exact nonnegative integer less than 24.
A day is an exact nonnegative integer in ranging from 1 representing
the first day of the month to $n$, where $n$ is the number of
days in the date's month and year.
A month is an exact nonnegative integer ranging from 1 through 12,
where 1 represents January, 2 represents February, and so on.
A year must be an exact integer.
Years less than 1970 or greater than 2038 may not be supported
depending on limitations of the underlying implementation.
A time-zone offset represents the time-zone offset, in seconds, from UTC.
It is an exact integer in the range $-86400$ to $+86400$, inclusive.
For example, Eastern Standard Time (EST), which is 5 hours east, has
offset $5\times 3600 = -18000$.
The offset for Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is $-14400$.
UTC is represented by offset zero.

These procedures are used to convert between time and date objects.
The \var{time} argument to \scheme{time-utc->date} must have time-type
\scheme{utc}, and \scheme{date->time-utc} always returns a time
object with time-type \scheme{utc}.

For \scheme{time-utc->date},
\var{offset} represents the time-zone offset in seconds east of UTC,
as described at the beginning of this section.
It must be an exact integer in the range $-86400$ to
$+86400$, inclusive and defaults to the local time-zone offset.
UTC may be obtained by passing an offset of zero.

If \var{offset} is not provided to \scheme{time-utc->date}, then the current time zone's offset

\var{sleep} causes the invoking thread to suspend operation for
approximately the amount of time indicated by the time object, unless
the process receives a signal that interrupts the sleep operation.
The actual time slept depends on the granularity of the system clock

\entryheader
\formdef{enable-object-counts}{\categoryglobalparameter}{enable-object-counts}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

The value of \scheme{enable-object-counts} is a boolean value that
determines whether the collector records object counts as it runs and
hence whether the object counts returned by the procedure
\scheme{object-counts} are accurate.
The parameter is set to \scheme{#f} by default, since enabling object
counts adds overhead to collection.

Counts for the static generation are always correct.
Counts for a nonstatic generation $n$ are correct immediately after a
collection of generation $m\ge n$ (regardless of whether the target
generation is $m$ or $m+1$) if \scheme{enable-object-counts}
was set to \scheme{#t} during the collection.

One strategy for collecting object counts with minimal overhead is
to enable object counts only while collecting the maximum nonstatic
generation and to obtain the object counts immediately after that
collection.

\entryheader
\formdef{object-counts}{\categoryprocedure}{(object-counts)}
\returns see below
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

The procedure \scheme{object-counts} returns a nested association list
representing object counts and bytes allocated for each heap-allocated
primitive type and record type with at least one live instance in one
or more generations.
(Heap-allocated primitive types include, e.g., pairs and vectors, but
not, e.g., fixnums or characters.)
Object counts are gathered by the collector only when
\scheme{enable-object-counts} is \scheme{#t}.
The description of \scheme{enable-object-counts} details the
circumstances under which the counts are accurate.

The association list returned by \scheme{object-counts} has the following
structure:

\schemedisplay
((\var{type} (\var{generation} \var{count} . \var{bytes}) \dots) \dots)
\endschemedisplay

\var{type} is either the name of a primitive type, represented as a
symbol, e.g., \scheme{pair}, or a record-type descriptor (rtd).
\var{generation} is a nonnegative fixnum between 0 and the value
of \scheme{(collect-maximum-generation)}, inclusive, or the symbol
\scheme{static} representing the static generation.
\var{count} and \var{bytes} are nonnegative fixnums.

\schemedisplay

\section{Cost Centers\label{SECTMISCCOSTCENTERS}}

Cost centers are used to track the bytes allocated, instructions executed,
and/or cpu time elapsed while evaluating selected sections of code.
Cost centers are created via the procedure \scheme{make-cost-center}, and
costs are tracked via the procedure \scheme{with-cost-center}.

Allocation and instruction counts are tracked only for code instrumented
for that purpose.
This instrumentation is controlled by two parameters: \scheme{generate-allocation-counts}
and \scheme{generate-instruction-counts}.
Instrumentation is disabled by default.
Built in procedures are not instrumented, nor is interpreted code or
non-Scheme code.
Elapsed time is tracked only when the optional \scheme{timed?} argument to
\scheme{with-cost-center} is provided and is not false.

The \scheme{with-cost-center} procedure accurately tracks costs, subject
to the caveats above, even when reentered with the same cost center, used
simultaneously in multiple threads, and exited or reentered one or more
times via continuation invocation.

\returns see below
\listlibraries

\var{thunk} must be a procedure that accepts zero arguments.
\scheme{with-cost-center} invokes \var{thunk} without arguments and
returns its values.
It also tracks, dynamically, the bytes allocated, instructions executed,
and cpu time elapsed while evaluating the invocation of \var{thunk} and
adds the tracked costs to the cost center's running record of these costs.

As described above, allocation counts are tracked only for code
compiled with the parameter \scheme{generate-allocation-counts} set
to true, and instruction counts are tracked only for code compiled
with \scheme{generate-instruction-counts} set to true.
Cpu time is tracked only if \var{timed?} is provided and not false and
includes cpu time spent in instrumented, uninstrumented, and non-Scheme
code.

\scheme{make-parameter} accepts one or two arguments.
The first argument is the initial value of the internal variable, and
the second, if present, is a \emph{filter} applied to the initial value
and all subsequent values.
The filter should accept one argument.
If the value is not appropriate, the filter should raise an exception or
convert the value into a more appropriate form.

For example, the default value of \scheme{print-length} is defined as
follows:

\schemedisplay
(define print-length
  (make-parameter
    #f
    (lambda (x)
      (unless (or (not x) (and (fixnum? x) (fx>= x 0)))
        (assertion-violationf 'print-length
          "~s is not a positive fixnum or #f"
          x))
      x)))
\endschemedisplay

\schemedisplay
(print-length)  ;=> #f
(print-length 3)
(print-length)  ;=> 3
(format "~s" '(1 2 3 4 5 6))  ;=> "(1 2 3 ...)"
(print-length #f)
(format "~s" '(1 2 3 4 5 6))  ;=> "(1 2 3 4 5 6)"
\endschemedisplay

The definition of \scheme{make-parameter} is straightforward using
\index{\scheme{case-lambda}}\scheme{case-lambda}:

\schemedisplay
(define make-parameter
  (case-lambda
    [(init guard)
     (let ([v (guard init)])
       (case-lambda
         [() v]
         [(u) (set! v (guard u))]))]
    [(init)
     (make-parameter init (lambda (x) x))]))
\endschemedisplay

In threaded versions of {\ChezScheme}, \scheme{make-parameter} creates
global parameters.
The procedure \scheme{make-thread-parameter}, described in
Section~\ref{SECTTHREADPARAMETERS}, may be used to make thread
parameters.

\entryheader
\formdef{parameterize}{\categorysyntax}{(parameterize ((\var{param} \var{expr}) \dots) \var{body_1} \var{body_2} \dots)}
\returns the values of the body \scheme{\var{body_1} \var{body_2} \dots}
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
Using the syntactic form \scheme{parameterize}, the values of parameters can
be changed in a manner analogous to \scheme{fluid-let} for ordinary variables.
Each \var{param} is set to the value of the corresponding
\var{expr} while the body is evaluated.
When control leaves the body by normal return or by the invocation of a
continuation created outside of the body, the parameters are restored to
their original values.
If control returns to the body via a continuation created during the
execution of the body, the parameters are again set to their temporary
values.

\schemedisplay
(define test
  (make-parameter 0))
(test)  ;=> 0
(test 1)
(test)  ;=> 1
(parameterize ([test 2])
  (test))  ;=> 2
(test)  ;=> 1
(parameterize ([test 2])
  (test 3)
  (test))  ;=> 3
(test)  ;=> 1
(define k (lambda (x) x))
(begin (set! k (call/cc k))
       'k)  ;=> k
(parameterize ([test 2])
  (test (call/cc k))
  (test))  ;=> k
(test)  ;=> 1
(k 3)  ;=> 3
(test)  ;=> 1
\endschemedisplay

The definition of \scheme{parameterize} is similar to the definition of
\scheme{fluid-let} (page~\pageref{defn:fluid-let}):

\schemedisplay
(define-syntax parameterize
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_ () b1 b2 ...) #'(begin b1 b2 ...)]
      [(_ ((x e) ...) b1 b2 ...)
       (with-syntax ([(p ...) (generate-temporaries #'(x ...))]
                     [(y ...) (generate-temporaries #'(x ...))])
         #'(let ([p x] ... [y e] ...)
             (let ([swap (lambda ()
                           (let ([t (p)]) (p y) (set! y t))
                           ...)])
               (dynamic-wind swap (lambda () b1 b2 ...) swap))))])))
\endschemedisplay

\section{Virtual registers\label{SECTVIRTUALREGISTERS}}

A limited set of \emph{virtual registers} is supported by the compiler
for use by programs that require high-speed, global, and mutable storage
locations.
Referencing or assigning a virtual register is potentially faster and
never slower than accessing an assignable local or global variable,
and the code sequences for doing so are generally smaller.
Assignment is potentially significantly faster because there is no need
to track pointers from the virtual registers to young objects, as there
is for variable locations that might reside in older generations.
On threaded versions of the system, virtual registers are ``per thread''
and thus serve as thread-local storage in a manner that is less expensive
than thread parameters.

The interface consists of three procedures: \scheme{virtual-register-count},
which returns the number of virtual registers, \scheme{set-virtual-register!},
which sets the value of a specified virtual register, and
\scheme{virtual-register}, which retrieves the value of a specified
virtual register.

A virtual register is specified by a nonnegative fixnum index less than
the number of virtual registers.
To get optimal performance for \scheme{set-virtual-register!}
and \scheme{virtual-register}, the index should be a constant
embedded right in the call (or propagatable via optimization to the
call).
To avoid putting these constants in the source code, programmers should
consider using identifier macros to give names to virtual registers, e.g.:

\schemedisplay
(define-syntax current-state
  (identifier-syntax
    [id (virtual-register 0)]
    [(set! id e) (set-virtual-register! 0 e)]))
(set! current-state 'start)
current-state ;=> start
\endschemedisplay

A more elaborate macro could dole out indices at compile time and complain
when no more indices are available.

Virtual-registers must be treated as an application-level resource, i.e.,
libraries intended to be used by multiple applications should generally
not use virtual registers to avoid conflicts with an application's use of
the registers.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{virtual-register-count}{\categoryprocedure}{(virtual-register-count)}
\returns the number of virtual registers
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

As of Version~9.0, the number of virtual registers is set at 16.
It cannot be changed except by recompiling {\ChezScheme} from
source.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{set-virtual-register!}{\categoryprocedure}{(set-virtual-register! \var{k} \var{x})}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\scheme{set-virtual-register!} stores \var{x} in virtual register \var{k}.
\var{k} must be a nonnegative fixnum less than the value of
\scheme{(virtual-register-count)}.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{virtual-register}{\categoryprocedure}{(virtual-register \var{k})}
\returns see below
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\scheme{virtual-register} returns the value most recently
stored in virtual register \var{k} (on the current thread, in
threaded versions of the system).


\section{Environmental Queries and Settings\label{SECTSYSTEMENV}}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\noskipentryheader
\formdef{scheme-version}{\categoryprocedure}{(scheme-version)}
\returns a version string
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

The version string is in the form

\schemedisplay
"Chez Scheme Version \var{version}"
\endschemedisplay

for {\ChezScheme}, and

\schemedisplay
"Petite Chez Scheme Version \var{version}"
\endschemedisplay

for {\PetiteChezScheme}.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{scheme-version-number}{\categoryprocedure}{(scheme-version-number)}
\returns three values: the major, minor, and sub-minor version numbers
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

Each of the three return values is a nonnegative fixnum.

In {\ChezScheme} Version 7.9.4:

\schemedisplay
(scheme-version-number) ;=> 7
                        ;== 9
                        ;== 4
\endschemedisplay


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{petite?}{\categoryprocedure}{(petite?)}
\returns \scheme{#t} if called in {\PetiteChezScheme}, \scheme{#f} otherwise
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

The only difference between {\PetiteChezScheme} and {\ChezScheme} is that
the compiler is not available in the former, so this predicate can serve as
a way to determine if the compiler is available.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{threaded?}{\categoryprocedure}{(threaded?)}
\returns \scheme{#t} if called in a threaded version of the system, \scheme{#f} otherwise
\listlibraries
\endentryheader


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{interactive?}{\categoryprocedure}{(interactive?)}
\returns \scheme{#t} if system is run interactively, \scheme{#f} otherwise
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

This predicate returns \scheme{#t} if the Scheme process's
stdin and stdout are connected to a tty (Unix-based systems) or console
(Windows).
Otherwise, it returns \scheme{#f}.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{get-process-id}{\categoryprocedure}{(get-process-id)}
\returns the operating system process id of the current process
\listlibraries
\endentryheader



%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\noskipentryheader
\formdef{getenv}{\categoryprocedure}{(getenv \var{key})}
\returns environment value of \var{key} or \scheme{#f}
\listlibraries
\endnoskipentryheader

\noindent
\var{key} must be a string.
\scheme{getenv} returns the operating system shell's environment value
associated with \var{key}, or \scheme{#f} if no environment value
is associated with \var{key}.

\schemedisplay
(getenv "HOME") ;=> "/u/freddy"
\endschemedisplay

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{putenv}{\categoryprocedure}{(putenv \var{key} \var{value})}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\var{key} and \var{value} must be strings.

\scheme{putenv} stores the \var{key}, \var{value} pair in the
environment of the process,
where it is available to the current process (e.g., via \var{getenv})
and any spawned processes.

\schemedisplay
(putenv "SCHEME" "rocks!")
(getenv "SCHEME") ;=> "rocks!"
\endschemedisplay


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\entryheader
\formdef{get-registry}{\categoryprocedure}{(get-registry \var{key})}
\returns registry value of \var{key} or \scheme{#f}
\formdef{put-registry!}{\categoryprocedure}{(put-registry! \var{key} \var{val})}
\formdef{remove-registry!}{\categoryprocedure}{(remove-registry! \var{key})}
\returns unspecified
\listlibraries
\endentryheader

\noindent
\var{key} and \var{val} must be strings.

\scheme{get-registry} returns a string containing the registry
value of \var{key} if the value exists.
If no registry value for \var{key} exists, \scheme{get-registry} returns
\scheme{#f}.

\scheme{put-registry!} sets the registry
value of \var{key} to \var{val}.
It raises an exception with condition type \scheme{&assertion} if the
value cannot be set, which may happen if
the user has insufficient access.

\scheme{remove-registry!} removes the registry
key or value named by \var{key}.
It raises an exception with condition type \scheme{&assertion} if the
value cannot be removed.
Reasons for failure include the key not being present, the user having
insufficient access, or \var{key} being a key with subkeys.

These routines are defined for Windows only.

\schemedisplay
(get-registry "hkey_local_machine\\Software\\North\\South") ;=> #f
(put-registry! "hkey_local_machine\\Software\\North\\South" "east")
(get-registry "hkey_local_machine\\Software\\North\\South") ;=> "east"
(remove-registry! "hkey_local_machine\\Software\\North")
(get-registry "hkey_local_machine\\Software\\North\\South") ;=> #f
\endschemedisplay


\section{Subset Modes\label{SECTMISCSUBSETMODE}}

\noskipentryheader
\formdef{subset-mode}{\categorythreadparameter}{subset-mode}
\listlibraries
\endnoskipentryheader

\noindent
The value of this parameter
must be \scheme{#f} (the default) or the symbol \scheme{system}.
Setting \scheme{subset-mode} to \scheme{system} allows the manipulation
of various undocumented system variables, data structures, and
settings.
It is typically used only for system debugging.
